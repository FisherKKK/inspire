### [The Economics of Transformative AI](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/epFKhn24trRP2cs3k/the-economics-of-transformative-ai)

**来源**: LessWrong - AI

**摘要**: Published on January 8, 2026 10:22 PM GMT<br /><br /><p><i>Anton Korinek is an economist at UVA and the Brookings Institution who focuses on the macroeconomics of AI. This is a lightly edited transcript of a recent lecture where he lays out what economics actually predicts about transformative AI — in our view it's the best introductory resource on the topic, and basically anyone discussing post-labour economics should be familiar with this.</i></p><p><i>The talk covers historical development of what the bottlenecks are: for most of history, land was the bottleneck and humans were disposable. The Industrial Revolution flipped this. AI may flip it again: if labor becomes reproducible, humans are no longer the bottleneck.</i></p><p><i>Korinek walks through what this implies for growth (potentially dramatic), for wages (likely positive effects until some threshold of automation, then a sudden collapse), and for policy (e.g. our entire tax system assumes labor income exists). He also addresses some confusions: "prices falling" and "productivity rising"; "post-scarcity" is a misnomer since even cheap resources have prices; and no, there's no economic law that technology must create jobs—that was just an empirical regularity when humans were the bottleneck.</i></p><p><i>The uncomfortable conclusion is the economy doesn't need us. It can run perfectly well "of the machines, by the machines, and for the machines." Whether that's what we want is a different question.</i><br /><br />Transcript is under the video</p><figure class="media"><div><div></div></div></figure><p>I want to start by talking about some high-level lessons about the economics of transformative AI—or the economics of AGI, which are not exactly the same but close substitutes to each other. I've split this into three big themes which I call "the good", "the bad," and "the ugly".</p><p>What do I mean by that? There is the productivity and growth impact of AGI, transformative AI—that's "the good". There is the labor market disruption and inequality aspect—which is "the bad". And then there are the TAI risks and alignment. I unfortunately don't have very much to say on that, but I'm still including it—which is "the ugly". It also has some economic repercussions. So let's first jump into the good, so that we can end on a high point.</p><figure class="image image_resized" style="width: 768px;"><img alt="Three Categories of Economic Impacts: Productivity and Growth (the good), Labor Market Disruption and Inequality (the bad), TAI Risks and Alignment (the ugly)" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/epFKhn24trRP2cs3k/troxf36pypv6jbwsbohd" /></figure><h2><strong>The Good: Productivity and Growth</strong></h2><p>I'll start with some economics 101. You can forget about the equations, but maybe some of you have seen this in your undergraduate econ. The way that we economists think about the economy is that we produce output Y by combining capital K and labor L through some sort of production function. That production function operates at a certain level of technology, which we call A. We mix those two things together, use our technology, and produce output.</p><figure class="image image_resized" style="width: 768px;"><img alt="Economics 101: Output Y = A*F(K, L) depends on technology A, capital K, and labor L; Consumption C = Y - I - G is what's left after investment I and govt spending G; Utility U = u(C) is how happy the consumption makes us" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/epFKhn24trRP2cs3k/dajs6e3ucdr3uowvl9i7" /></figure><p>From that output, we take a part and invest it, we take a part and use it for government spending, and the rest is consumption. And that consumption—I guess that's the critical part—is supposed to deliver us some sort of utility u(C). So the big question that I want to unpack in the next 20 minutes or so is: how will AGI affect all of that, and what will all these effects depend on?</p><h3><strong>What the Most Cited Economist Thinks</strong></h3><p>Let's start with the good. What will the output effects of AGI depend on? Well, if we ask the most cited economist in the world, Daron Acemoglu, he published a paper last year on <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w32487/w32487.pdf">"The Simple Macroeconomics of AI"</a> in which he predicted that AI will affect growth by raising it by 0.07% a year. So he does not believe that this is going to be very transformative. He thinks AI is essentially BS.</p><p>But that means there is more work for us to be done. This guy is the closest thing to an economic super-intelligence—if he doesn't pay attention to these questions, then I guess many of us have to.</p><h3><strong>A Longer Arc of History</strong></h3><p>I think to take this question seriously, we have to actually take a step back and look at a much longer arc of history to understand how transformative AI will be for the economy.</p><p>In prior decades—or even for the past two centuries—everything in the economy revolved around capital and labor. But if we take a step even further back towards the Malthusian age, it wasn't always like that.</p><p>During the Malthusian times, the most important factor of production, the most important thing to produce output in the economy, was actually land. And then you needed human labor to work the land. But unfortunately, the human labor was actually pretty dispensable. The way that economists put it is the marginal human had just enough to cover their subsistence needs. What they ate and what they produced was roughly equal, which means they did not produce any excess economic value. This is what Malthus described as essentially the Malthusian trap.</p><p>During Malthusian times—during the Middle Ages and so on—human populations multiplied until they ran out of resources to sustain themselves. So everybody, or at least everybody except for a few special kings and so on had just enough to meet their basic necessities. Living standards were very low. Utility, as we economists would characterize it, was not particularly high. In some sense, from a material perspective, those were pretty bleak times—people were not doing particularly well. But since land was essentially the bottleneck factor of the economy, those who controlled the land were the most powerful: the lords.</p><h3><strong>The Industrial Revolution</strong></h3><p>Well, then something really miraculous happened: the industrial revolution—driven probably by scientific advances, the age of enlightenment, and so on. What happened during the industrial revolution is that we developed technologies to produce stuff so that land was no longer the primary bottleneck factor in the economy. Instead, we started to produce things with machines, and we combined those machines with labor. That gave us the productive structure that all of you who took econ 101 saw in your undergraduate studies, where we combine capital and labor to produce output. This is just given as one of the most fundamental economic laws—although, maybe it will soon no longer be that way.</p><p>The other thing that happened with the industrial revolution is that we suddenly started to advance technology in a sustained way. Technology started to progress at a rate of like one-and-a-half to two percent. We constructed more and more machines, and the accumulation of better technologies and more capital allowed the economy to grow—and to grow in a sustained way.</p><p>But what was the bottleneck? The bottleneck was suddenly the human: the human worker. Humans did not multiply at the same rate as technological progress advanced and as we accumulated capital. That means humans became very scarce. And that scarcity of human labor is what drove the sustained advances in living standards over the past two-and-a-half centuries, and what made living standards in advanced countries something like 20× what they were before the industrial revolution.</p><p>So the fact that we were the bottleneck, the fact that we were scarce—that's what made us economically valuable, and that's what basically supported the standard of living that all of us are experiencing today.</p><figure class="image image_resized" style="width: 768px;"><img alt="Economic Paradigm Shift Under AGI: The Malthusian Age (Technology stagnant, Land bottleneck, Labor dispensable), The Industrial Age (Technology driving force, Labor bottleneck, Capital reproducible), The Age of AI (Technology accelerating, Capital reproducible, Labor reproducible)" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/epFKhn24trRP2cs3k/xj0pnojheafiiahb4efl" /></figure><h3><strong>The Age of AI</strong></h3><p>Now we may be about to enter the age of AI. What's going to happen there?</p><p>Technology is almost certainly going to accelerate. Capital, just like it was during the industrial age, can be reproduced. But labor is no longer bound to how many human bodies we have—it can also be simply reproduced by starting up another server farm, by building another robot.</p><p>And those machines are going to compete with human labor.</p><p>All the indications right now are that they are going to perform the kinds of jobs that humans can perform at what is currently a lower cost. And if a machine can perform your job, then competitive forces will ultimately drive your wage to the cost of the machine.</p><h3><strong>Simulating the Output Effects</strong></h3><p>What will this imply for output? I have some simulations in a paper that <a href="https://www.imf.org/-/media/files/publications/fandd/article/2023/december/30-33-korinek-final.pdf">I published</a> with the IMF two years ago. The bottom line shows the baseline of how growth proceeded for the past couple of decades, and then there are two AGI scenarios which essentially assume that we automate the economy within five years versus within 20 years. The faster we automate everything, the faster growth takes off. I'll discuss the effects on wages when we talk about the labor market in the corresponding diagram.</p><figure class="image image_resized"><img alt="Output simulation showing Traditional, Baseline AGI, and Aggressive AGI scenarios over 30 years. Output grows dramatically under AGI scenarios." src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/epFKhn24trRP2cs3k/pkw5zsq5l8axh2pyjois" /></figure><p>SOURCE: Anton Korinek. NOTE: AGI = artificial general intelligence.</p><p>So, back more conceptually to the output effects. These output effects are going to be driven by technological progress, because I think all of us expect that AGI will allow us to make advances—both scientific advances and organizational advances—more quickly than what we currently can in the human economy.</p><p>They will be driven by automating labor. And I think it's important—I visit this website every couple of weeks just to make sure I really read it correctly. The charter of OpenAI, for example, mentions <a href="https://openai.com/charter/">"highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work"</a>. Well, that means if they really succeed at what they're saying, then labor is toast.</p><p>But right now I'm supposed to talk about the good—the output effects. The good is: if you relieve this bottleneck of humans, if you basically allow machines to perform all the valuable tasks in the economy, then you can grow the economy to a much bigger size. You can expand output and move beyond that bottleneck. That means growth rates that are currently unthinkable may be possible.</p><p>One way of thinking about it—you hear all these numbers, is it going to be 20% or 50%, I have no idea—but one way of thinking about it is: imagine you have robots and server farms. How long is it going to take those robots and server farms together to double themselves? That's going to give you a good perspective on what reasonable estimates of growth rates will be.</p><p>And the third factor that's also very important: <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w31815/w31815.pdf">we need this capital accumulation</a>. We need these additional machines, these additional robots and server farms, in order to advance growth in the economy.</p><h3><strong>The Intelligence Explosion</strong></h3><p>Now what may this growth takeoff look like, and what may it be driven by? <a href="https://www.aof.org.hk/docs/default-source/hkimr/conference-workshop/paper-present-2a_basil-halperin.pdf?sfvrsn=4c8ee08d_2">In a paper</a> that I'm about to put out with three co-authors—Tom Davidson, Basel Halper, and Tom Holden—we look at how an intelligence explosion may trigger essentially a growth takeoff.</p><figure class="image image_resized" style="width: 768px;"><img alt="Feedback Loops Driving a Growth Take-off: AI Labor feeds into Software Quality and Hardware Quality, which drive Total Factor Productivity, Output, and Capital accumulation in reinforcing loops." src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/epFKhn24trRP2cs3k/uvvbowsxwlolnh3jtrhu" /></figure><p>Source: "Is Automating AI Research Enough for a Growth Explosion?" (with T. Davidson, B.Halperin, and T. Houlden), Nov. 2025</p><p>In one diagram, the right column shows you how economic growth proceeded during the industrial age. You had output being driven by advances in technology—or total factor productivity, as we call it technically in economics—and by the accumulation of capital. Total factor productivity kind of fed on itself, because if you have better technology, you can produce even further advances in the future. And the capital stock rose because we used part of our output for investment and accumulated more of it. So this right column captures what is driving growth during the industrial age.</p><p>Now what would happen if we do experience AGI, and what are the potential dynamics for an intelligence explosion?</p><p>First of all, we would suddenly have all this AI labor that can perform tasks that previously were reserved for human labor. Having all this additional labor will immediately allow our output to jump up. In addition, a lot of that labor can be dedicated to advancing technology—to increasing total factor productivity.</p><p>Now let's unpack what drives the increase in AI labor. There are two forces: the first one is advancing software quality, and the second one is advancing hardware quality, plus hardware accumulation. These two can feed back on each other and imply that essentially the available amount of AI labor is going to grow very rapidly, therefore drive these increases in productivity and increases in output.</p><h3><strong>Important Factors to Consider</strong></h3><p>I want to add a little bit more texture and discuss a few factors that I think are important to keep in mind if we dig a little bit more into the weeds.</p><figure class="image image_resized" style="width: 768px;"><img alt="Output Effects: Adding More Texture - Three further considerations: 1. Bottlenecks = 'weakest links' in the chain of production (may hold back economic growth and disruption), 2. Cognitive and physical work are complements (In short term, AGI will raise the value of physical actuators), 3. In the long term, the ultimate bottleneck is unclear – E = mc²?" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/epFKhn24trRP2cs3k/ivspyxmliqwkufd3vz7h" /></figure><p><strong>Bottlenecks.</strong> In some ways, you can say bottlenecks are like the weakest link in the chain of expanding output. They are what's holding us back from producing more. The simplest story is like the O-ring story: if you need to follow 100 steps to produce something but you can only automate 99 of them, and the hundredth relies on some bottleneck, then you cannot produce more because that bottleneck is always going to hold you back.</p><p>In practice, it's not going to be as stark. Bottlenecks can be to some extent substituted for. If you don't have enough energy, you can focus on developing technologies that do the same thing with a little bit less energy. So you can get around bottlenecks. But still, the more bottlenecks there are—and many of them we're probably not aware of yet—the more that will hold back economic growth.</p><p><strong>Cognitive versus physical work.</strong> This is a really important distinction that is oftentimes conflated in this debate. For all those of you with aggressive timelines, your timelines are probably at first about cognitive advances—about the fact that AI may take off on the intelligence side. But that may or may not give rise to physical automation. And even if we have the physical automation, we also have to produce a lot of machines, a lot of robots to take full advantage of that.</p><p>I'll go back again to OpenAI's charter. They wrote about basically automating the majority of economically valuable tasks. Now, the majority of economically valuable tasks is actually physical, or involves at least some physical component. It's only—depending on how exactly you measure it—10 to 20% of the economy that is purely cognitive. I guess many of us are in that segment, and that's why we can feel it acutely.</p><p>But still, the majority of jobs has an important physical component. If we only have cognitive intelligence at human or superhuman levels, that doesn't mean that we should expect a dramatic growth takeoff. It only means that we can do these 10 or 20% of the economy much more efficiently. What that means is: if that happens, there's going to be so much economic value in automating the physical parts as well, so we should expect a lot of investment flowing into that.</p><p><strong>Progressive bottleneck relief.</strong> You can think of the long trajectory of economic development as progressively relieving bottlenecks. The industrial revolution relieved the bottleneck of land but then introduced the bottleneck of labor. Now we may be on the verge of relieving the bottleneck of labor, and it's not quite clear what will hold back growth after that. It may be energy. It may be the availability of certain rare earths. I don't know—none of them seems like the obvious predominant one, especially if we are really close to fusion or things like that. Ultimately—and I'm listening to people like Anders when I say something like that—maybe it's just going to be energy and matter within our event horizon. But that's kind of beyond my expertise. It's a huge economic question, because whatever is the bottleneck will be the most valuable.</p><h3><strong>Confusions Between Economists and Technologists</strong></h3><p>I want to talk about some confusions that sometimes occur in the debate between economists and technologists.</p><p><strong>Productivity versus prices.</strong> Economists always like to talk about productivity, but technologists oftentimes talk about prices going down. In some sense, that's actually just using different language for the same thing. I remember Sam Altman wrote this blog post <a href="https://moores.samaltman.com/">"Moore's Law for Everything"</a> in which he suggested the prices of everything are going to halve every two years in accordance with Moore's law.</p><p>We economists don't really measure things in dollar terms when we talk about GDP—we measure them in real terms, adjusted for price changes. So if you say prices go down by half every two years, what you may be meaning is: we can produce the same dollar amount but at half the price, which would correspond to we can produce twice as much every two years—which would be a growth rate of like the square root of two, 41% or something like that a year.</p><p>Those two statements are economically equivalent. Economists prefer talking about the growth rate adjusted for prices. Halving costs means essentially doubling productivity. And one of the reasons is because prices ultimately are a unit of account. It doesn't really matter whether you say my economy is $1 trillion big or 100 trillion yen big—it's the same, you just convert things. People in Japan are not wealthier because $1 is 100 yen. These are just units of account, and we want to adjust for that to measure the real effects of economic growth.</p><p><strong>Post-scarcity.</strong> This is maybe more of a very strong opinion on my side than a confusion. I think in part inspired by Star Trek and so on, a lot of people talk about a post-scarcity economy. If they use that term to just say an economy that will be a lot wealthier, in which there will be a lot more abundance, then I'm okay with that.</p><p>But technically, we economists call a resource "scarce" whenever it has a nonzero price. Even if something is really cheap, it meets that definition. Now, if AI takes off in a good way and produces all this abundance for us, resources will still have nonzero prices. There will be a lot more of them, but they will still be valuable, and the relative value of different resources is going to be reflected in their relative prices. So I think it makes more sense to talk about material abundance than about post-scarcity.</p><figure class="image image_resized" style="width: 768px;"><img alt="Clearing Up Some Confusions: In the language of economists, we describe growth in productivity, output, wages in cost-adjusted ('real') terms; halving costs = doubling productivity; ultimately, only relative prices matter. Scarcity = something has non-zero price, even if the price is very, very low; material abundance ≠ 'post-scarcity'" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/epFKhn24trRP2cs3k/jv3sddort7cv4q0jm29k" /></figure><p>One thought experiment that's highly useful in this context: imagine we were having this conversation in 1800, and we're going to talk about a post-Malthusian economy because some people are very foresightful and are seeing the writings of the industrial revolution on the wall. Imagine you told people, "Okay, every one of you is going to be 20 times wealthier in 200 years from now." People would say, "Well, that's unbelievable—it's inconceivable."</p><p>In some sense, you could say we almost already live in this post-scarcity economy compared to the conceptions that people had in 1800. But for a lot of people, it doesn't quite feel like post-scarcity. Prices are still positive, and what matters are their incomes relative to those prices.</p><h2><strong>The Bad: Labor Market Disruption and Inequality</strong></h2><p>That brings me to the bad—the potential labor market disruptions and inequality effects. Again, what will drive these? What will they depend on?</p><p>Here I won't start by citing Daron Acemoglu, but I will put up <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/05/28/ai-jobs-white-collar-unemployment-anthropic">an interview by Dario Amodei that he gave with Axios a couple of months ago</a>, in which he warned that AI could wipe out half of all entry-level white collar jobs and spike unemployment to 10 to 20% in the next—there's a wide confidence interval—one to five years. So this is what an industry insider describes as the potential labor market effects.</p><h3><strong>The Economic Channels</strong></h3><p>Let me look at what are the economic channels that would drive this disruption.</p><p>The first one—and I should say that I'm talking about the channels that drive the effects on the labor market, because some of these effects are positive—is just technological progress, which has a tendency of lifting all boats, of making everybody more productive. If I just give you ChatGPT or Claude or Gemini, you are more productive as a worker, and that makes your labor more valuable.</p><p>The second one, which is the hugely disruptive one, is the automation of labor. Again, if a machine can do a worker's job, the worker's wage will tend towards the machine's cost.</p><p>And the third one, which is again positive, is capital accumulation. If I give you better machines to work with, then your labor becomes more valuable.</p><p>So what this tells us is there are three main channels. Two of them are actually positive, but one of them is negative. Ultimately, there is a horse race going on between the positive and negative effects. In the short term, it is plausible that a lot of workers are going to benefit from the positive effects. But then if we reach the full AGI as in this definition here, I think it is very likely that the negative effects are going to predominate.</p><h3><strong>Adding More Texture</strong></h3><p><strong>Task displacement versus job displacement.</strong> Right now we are talking about task displacement rather than job displacement. Right now, there are very few jobs that can be wholly done by AI, and a lot of the economic work in this area is on which tasks can be replaced, not which jobs can be replaced.</p><p><strong>Labor demand, not just jobs.</strong> A second point I want to emphasize: when you read the newspaper, you often hear about what will be the jobs impact of AI. But the more interesting and more useful question from an economic perspective is: what will be the effects on labor demand?</p><p>The reason I say that's more useful is that we think of the labor market as an equilibrium driven by both demand and supply. What usually happens—and what has been happening for the past 200 years—is the supply of labor has been pretty much fixed. Essentially, every working-age adult nowadays, or the vast majority who are not busy for family reasons, are supplying their labor to the labor market. That means supply is pretty much inelastic, as we say. So supply is fixed, but labor demand is what fluctuates when technology fluctuates.</p><p>If you reduce labor demand but you have a fixed supply, what happens in equilibrium is that wages actually bear the brunt of adjustment. In the very short term, there's some job displacement. But as the economy re-equilibrates, wages go down, and the total number of jobs is not materially different from before the shock—but you can see that wages are at a lower level when you have a negative labor market shock. That means focusing just on the job numbers may be a useful short-term guide, but talking about medium- to longer-term developments, we have to focus on wages, not just jobs. And that's captured by essentially the relationship that we call the demand curve, which captures at which wage will employers hire how many workers.</p><h3><strong>Simulation Results</strong></h3><p>Let me show you a simulation from <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w32255/w32255.pdf">a paper on scenarios for the transition to AGI</a>, in which we trace out how the fraction of automated tasks will affect both the wage bill and the returns to capital.</p><figure class="image image_resized" style="width: 768px;"><img alt="Labor Market Effects of AGI: Graph showing Output Y, Wage Bill wL, and Return on Capital RK against Fraction of Automated Tasks. Wages rise until ~80% automation, then plummet as returns shift to capital." src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/epFKhn24trRP2cs3k/oe6kckl6gdx2omqqgvnp" /></figure><p>See Korinek and Suh, "Scenarios for the Transition to AGI," NBER, May 2024</p><p>What you can see is: if you automate, and if capital and labor are complements, at first labor becomes more and more valuable because it makes the economy more productive to use machines for tasks that previously required very scarce labor. That means at first, almost all of the benefits go to labor.</p><p>But then, after a specific threshold—here in this simulation it's like 80% automation—all of a sudden, the abundance of capital and the fact that we need workers only for very few remaining jobs implies that wages plummet and that all the returns suddenly go to capital.</p><p>This is one specific simulation and specific parameter values, but I want to put it up just to show the possibility that as we automate, for a long time we'll see positive effects on labor, and then they may suddenly flip.</p><p>And now I'll show you the counterpart to the output effects of growth on the wage front. The baseline was that wages and output kind of grow in tandem, but if we have AI in 20 years or five years, then you can see that wages at first rise faster, and then they plummet.</p><figure class="image image_resized" style="width: 768px;"><img alt="Two charts showing Output and Wages over 30 years.

Note: AGI = artificial general intelligence.</p><h3><strong>Where Does the Value Go?</strong></h3><p>If labor is devalued, the big question is: where does the value go? Because the value doesn't disappear. If we can do something more cheaply—let's say using an AI that costs a hundredth of the cost of a worker right now—that means the economy is still producing the same thing. And the value goes, depending on how the economy is arranged, either to workers or capitalists, or frankly a lot of it just goes to consumers. Which is actually good, but it also highlights the importance of distributive policies.</p><h3><strong>Managing the Transition</strong></h3><p>That's where I want to go next. Managing the transition is going to be particularly hard. There will be big winners and big losers on the road to AI. The big winners never want to share what they won. The big losers always want to be compensated and don't want to lose.</p><p>There will be an important role for steering technological progress—maybe also a role for slowing down progress, because having so many winners and losers is hugely disruptive.</p><p>There are many longer-term policies that are being discussed: UBI, UBK, job guarantees, compute slices. <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/2022.08.10_Korinek-Juelfs-Final.pdf">Right now in the economic policy debate</a>, they all seem outlandish. Nobody's taking these seriously except on the fringes of the political spectrum—which is too bad, if we are expecting these disruptions to happen very quickly.</p><p>And of course, there are very important non-economic forces as well: what does this all mean for meaning, for control, for agency, and so on.</p><h3><strong>Adjusting the Tax System</strong></h3><p>In <a href="https://www.nber.org/books-and-chapters/economics-transformative-ai/public-finance-age-ai-primer">a recent paper</a>, I look at how our tax system will have to adjust under AGI. Right now, you can say that taxes on labor τ<sub>L</sub> are the primary way of raising revenue. But if labor suddenly becomes devalued, our government is not going to have a lot of financial resources. That means in the post-labor economy, we have to switch at first to the taxation of consumption τ<sub>C</sub>, and then ultimately to the taxation of the capital accumulation of AI itself.</p><figure class="image image_resized" style="width: 768px;"><img alt="Public Finance in the Age of AI: Table showing role of tax instruments (Labor, Consumption, Capital) across evolving AI scenarios from current economy to AGI-centered economy" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/epFKhn24trRP2cs3k/lugvxxr9hnmh8vctj25i" /></figure><p>See Korinek and Lockwood, "Public Finance in the Age of AI," NBER Economics of TAI, Nov 2025.</p><h3><strong>Roles for Labor in the Post-AI Economy</strong></h3><p>There will be some roles left for labor in the post-AI economy. Some of them transitional, some of them for fundamental human-centric purposes. But from my perspective, it is unlikely that the importance and the share of labor in overall economic value will be anywhere near where it is right now.</p><figure class="image image_resized" style="width: 768px;"><img alt="Roles for Labor Post-AGI: Temporary Technical and Social Barriers (Production and diffusion lags, Implicit knowledge, Trust and perceived human superiority, Laws and regulatory reasons) vs Fundamental Human-Centric Aspects (Authenticity of human connection, Human identity in sports and arts, Religious beliefs and practices, AI alignment and oversight)" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/epFKhn24trRP2cs3k/ftqndrxjtteltfb9lhpr" /></figure><h3><strong>Clearing Up Confusions</strong></h3><p>Again, I want to clear up some confusions in the debate.</p><p><strong>There is no "economic law" that new technologies always create jobs.</strong> In fact, it's just the law of demand and supply that as long as people are willing to supply their labor at any price, the market is going to hire them. And sometimes the price needs to go down to clear the market. Sometimes the price goes down a lot, as people during the disruptions of industries in the Midwest experienced in the past few decades.</p><p>There is no fundamental law that labor always plays some sacred role in the economy. It was just an empirical regularity for the past 200 years.</p><p><strong>What ultimately matters is relative prices.</strong> Even if the price of everything declines—or some other form of what Sam Altman predicted in <a href="https://moores.samaltman.com/">"Moore's Law for Everything"</a>—what ultimately matters for workers is how fast the price of their consumption goods declines compared to their wages.</p><p>There are a lot of reasons to expect that wages are going to go down faster than energy prices. And a lot of the things that we consume to keep ourselves alive, like food, require a lot of energy. So I think even if you have a strong belief that everything will become cheaper, labor is going to get cheaper even faster.</p><h2><strong>The Ugly: Risks and Alignment</strong></h2><p>Last point: the ugly—the risks of AGI and alignment.</p><figure class="image image_resized" style="width: 768px;"><img alt="The Ugly: TAI Risks and Alignment - Main economic challenge: Trading off E[cost of doom] vs E[benefit of abundance and longer lives]; Vast externalities: the benefits and costs of TAI risks are not borne equally" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/epFKhn24trRP2cs3k/t13zln866m3hcfmzhh4k" /></figure><h3><strong>Economic Aspects of Alignment</strong></h3><p>First, I want to observe that there are a number of really important economic aspects to alignment.</p><p>People need material resources to survive. We may be able to do things more efficiently and so on, but we need some sort of income.</p><p>Something else that's inherent in human preferences: people don't like uncertainty—certainly not really big uncertainty. People don't like big inequality. People don't like excessively rapid change, in part because it entails a lot of uncertainty.</p><p>I think we need to consider all these factors when we want to align AI to human values, because these basic economic preferences are part of our human values.</p><h3><strong>The Central Economic Challenge</strong></h3><p>Ultimately, the main economic challenge in this debate is—to put it kind of in the brute and cold-blooded economic fashion—trading off the expected costs of disaster versus the expected benefits that AI may deliver, both in terms of abundance and in terms of things like longer lives.</p><p>In some sense, you can see that lives are both on the left-hand side and on the right-hand side of this tradeoff. If the AGI kills us, that's a cost. But if it makes us all live for hundreds of years, that's also a benefit in terms of lives—not just in terms of pure abundance.</p><p>But I think the central part is: there are vast externalities in who makes these tradeoffs. Right now, it is a handful of executives in a handful of very powerful organizations that are making the decision on behalf of all of humanity. And their decisions entail vast externalities—vastly asymmetric payoffs. If they succeed, they will pocket a huge amount of the benefits. If they lose, all of us are going to pay the costs. It's kind of the classical definition of an externality, and I don't think that's good.</p><h3><strong>Does the Economy Need Humans?</strong></h3><p>Let me clear up a confusion that you sometimes hear in this debate: Does the economy need humans? Does it need human demand?</p><p>No. For the economy, it is perfectly possible to have an economy that's driven only by the machines—to paraphrase Lincoln, to have an economy of the machines, by the machines, and for the machines. We don't need to be there for the economy to function.</p><p>But—sorry, <a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~duvenaud/">David</a>, you said we should not impose values—I do think that's not what we want.</p><p><i>Thank you.</i></p><br /><br /><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/epFKhn24trRP2cs3k/the-economics-of-transformative-ai#comments">Discuss</a>

### [Self-Help Tactics That Are Working For Me](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/LQCjTFGxCu5G4bs9f/self-help-tactics-that-are-working-for-me)

**来源**: LessWrong - AI

**摘要**: Published on January 8, 2026 6:00 PM GMT<br /><br /><div><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!O-r2!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff84cf5ed-8aa1-4f38-a5bf-b07836a0094f_1024x1024.webp" target="_blank"><div><img alt="" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/LQCjTFGxCu5G4bs9f/ositaeej4jps1qliankh" /><div><div></div></div></div></a><figcaption>Midjourney, “abstract composition on the theme of triumph, with trumpets and rays of light, Art Deco, Tamara de Lempicka, Benedetta Cappa, red and gold, heroic celebration epic pride”</figcaption></figure></div><p></p><p>In about September 2025, I decided to go on a self-help kick, mostly revolving around stuff like “self-esteem”, “confidence”, and “guilt/shame”. </p><p>Basically, I wanted to <em>no longer feel bad about myself (when unwarranted).</em></p><p>This has been working really well. In fact, I almost want to say I’m “done”, though I think it’s probably too early to be sure.</p><p>I wanted to log what’s been working for me, in case any of it is helpful or generalizable to other people. </p><p>Feel entirely free to skip this post if you’re not interested in the gooey details of my psyche.</p><p>On the other hand, I don’t actually believe that self-help is a shameful or uninteresting topic. How to handle your own psychology is a huge part of doing <em>anything</em>. And while my Substack isn’t mostly about me, it <em>is </em>something of a record of the things I’ve been interested in or working on at any given point, to the extent I’m free to talk about them in public. Self-help has been one of my “projects” lately, and I finally feel like I have justified, grounded opinions worth sharing about what works and what doesn’t (for me).</p><h3>Thingness</h3><p>A crucial heuristic I use for self-help is “thingness”, which is a bit hard to explain. </p><p>“Have you really had a breakthrough or not?” is a tough question — <a href="https://chrislakin.blog/p/flaky-breakthroughs">sometimes the feeling of “breakthrough” doesn’t last</a> and you go right back to your old habits. But it takes a really long time to assess that you’ve made publicly demonstrable, long-term progress. So what are some <em>early </em>signals that something is fruitful? </p><p>Introspectively, I need to experience some kind of discrete, unambiguous change; a <em>new thought</em> <em>or state</em>, a place I can tell I’ve literally never been before in my life. “Change” doesn’t imply “permanent change”, but lots of self-help doesn’t even pass the sniff test of “whether you can prove it to a third party or not, but being 100% honest with yourself, did you feel anything clear-cut <em>happen </em>inside you?”</p><p>For instance, I don’t believe <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Family_Systems_Model">IFS</a> has “thingness”, at least not for me. I went into that trance state, came up with a bunch of “parts”, wrote them down, and then even a few months later looked back at my writing and was like “what? heck no, i don’t have those as sub-personalities”. Stable sub-personalities just don’t seem like “natural categories” for describing what’s going on inside me, and nothing particularly changes or improves when I try on that conceptualization. There’s no “thingness.”</p><p><em>Usually</em>, “mere intellectualization” doesn’t have that property of “thingness”. It’s “just” words and ideas and it doesn’t click into your more basic emotional, behavioral, or motivational systems. But I’ve found that if you go back and forth between intellectually analyzing and emotionally/bodily “feeling into” ideas, then even rather abstract concepts can create that discrete “click” of change, that chunky “thingness”.</p><p>Years ago, I used to think “goals” were also sort of a “wrong concept” for what was going on inside me — too abstract, too removed from the roiling chaos of raw sensation and semi-raw impulse, and thus talking about “my goals” would always be in some sense fake — but now I’ve changed so that goals are actually closer to being <em>bona fide parts of my inner machinery</em>, so goal-oriented paradigms work much better for me. They “have thingness” for me now, though they didn’t earlier. </p><p>The following insights and tactics, which came in part from me, in part from talking to a lot of (both customized and default) LLM bots, and in part from talking to a few friends, are, I’m pretty confident, “actual things” in the sense I’ve been talking about. How big and how long-term an impact they’ll have on my life remains to be seen, but I’m optimistic.</p><h3>Insight #1: (Irrational) Guilt Is Actually Due To Fear Of Facing Someone’s Disapproval</h3><p>This sounds pretty obvious, but it’s not. It’s a claim about what’s the <em>cause </em>and what’s the <em>effect</em> (and therefore what’s the right point to intervene).</p><p>One could imagine an equally plausible statement that reverses the cause and effect  — “You only feel afraid of other people’s opinion because you have low self-esteem” — but I think that, at least for me,  that would be false. </p><p>The causality definitely goes {fear of a bad social reaction} → {beating up myself preemptively, as a defense mechanism}.</p><p>Why am I so confident of this? </p><p>Well, first of all, the fear is a very concrete, physical flinch reaction. I get startled easily when someone comes in the room and “catches” me goofing off, for instance. That feels very concrete and basic, close to the “bare metal” of the body and mind. Whereas “self-esteem” seems a lot more complex and cognitive, and a lot more unclear what it even means. </p><p>Secondly, I can notice a certain “soothing” effect from self-condemnatory thoughts like “I’m a terrible person.” I feel a tension, which is relieved when I denigrate myself. That’s suggestive that my “low self esteem” is a <em>strategy</em> that I instinctively reach for to solve some other problem, rather than a “primary” phenomenon.</p><p>This is great news, because it suggests a <em>tactic.</em></p><h3>Tactic #1: DIY Exposure Therapy for Social Disapproval</h3><p>There’s a known, evidence-based way to deal with phobias: graded exposure therapy! You start with the <em>mildest </em>version of the thing that triggers fear, and then sit with it until the fear goes away.</p><p>For me, this means <em>vividly visualizing the experience of the person in front of me showing disapproval of the thing I say or do</em>. </p><p>I’m pretty sensitive about social disapproval, so even simulated/imagined “exposure therapy” is productive for me. I can get a lot out of going through a mental “journey” where I imagine that someone whose opinion I care about has a negative reaction to what I’m doing, and simulate how I’d react and what would happen afterward, and find that it turns out okay.</p><p>“Mere” imagination is a bigger deal than most people think. Vivid, wholehearted imagination can do a lot of work towards allowing me to do new things in real life. I’ve been able to have conversations I was afraid of, simply by imagining them vividly ahead of time.</p><p>A real-life version of this exposure therapy I’ve also found useful is just making myself look at another person’s face, look into their eyes, and become highly aware of whether they seem to be “okay with me.” </p><p>Are they happy I’m here, with them, right now? Do they like what’s going on in the conversation? </p><p>The answer could be no! </p><p>Would I be able to mentally tolerate it, to not flinch away, if the truth was “actually I’m impatient for you to go/annoyed by what you just said/not a big fan of yours in general”? </p><p>The handful of times I’ve gotten into a state where I’m <em>really </em>prepared to see the truth whatever it may be — not defending against the worst-case scenario or bracing for it or distracting myself from it, but actually okay with it — it’s a strange, intense, hyper-present altered state, and <em>really </em>conducive to heightened intimacy and warmth. </p><p>It’s not possible to fully feel that someone likes<em> </em>you unless you are fully open to the possibility that they <em>don’t</em>. Once that “fluttering” of anxiety “stabilizes”, once the flinchy zapping around of your mind settles down into calm, some very odd (and good) things start to happen.</p><p>I actually haven’t done this tactic that often and I think there’s still a lot of room for improvement, but the experiences I’ve had have convinced me that it’s fruitful. </p><h3>Tactic #2: Positive Exposure Therapy</h3><p>There are some things — often they’re compliments people have given me — where thinking about them gives me a sense of mingled fear and excitement. Sort of like “it can’t be!!!” vibrating against “but wouldn’t it be wonderful???” </p><p>You can do exposure therapy against these things too. It’s an unusually fun and rewarding process, because you’re increasing your tolerance for an intensely <em>pleasant </em>stimulus. The end result is you keep the excitement but extinguish the fear.</p><p>You just keep going back and forth between your fearful “but it can’t be this good!!!” reaction and a calm “yes, it can, because XYZ, this is actually perfectly normal and comprehensible” perspective, until you can sort of hold both at the same time, and you watch the fear burning itself out like a guttering candle.</p><p>If you ever have a “special interest” that gets you <em>so </em>excited that you get overwhelmed and can’t talk about it, and you want to be able to “be normal” about it without losing your enthusiasm, that’s another candidate for positive exposure therapy. </p><p>Among other things, positive exposure therapy got me to:</p><h3>Insight #2: It Is Good That I Have Wants/Desires/Choices/Opinions/Etc</h3><p>One of the things I’ve historically felt bad about is that I’m not particularly self-effacing; I want stuff, I go after what I want, I have a lot of opinions, etc. I’ve been accused that “You just do as you damn well please,” and it’s not wrong. </p><p>And in the past, a big part of me would feel “it’s impossible for me to be a good person; I’m tainted with this willful<em> </em>nature!” </p><p>On the other hand, you could also describe this trait as <em>motivation</em>. Motivation, arguably, is essential for goodness. Anything valuable or worthwhile in this world is ultimately produced by people who are personally motivated towards it. So there can’t be anything wrong with the mere fact of having one’s own motivations!</p><p>And I have met people who thought my<em> </em>motivation was an admirable trait.</p><p>On some level I even have to admit that I <em>like </em>my will and always have. It is me, after all; how could I not?</p><p> So a few rounds of back-and-forth with positive exposure therapy got me comfortable with the idea that I’m a person with will/motivation/desire/etc and that this is a good thing. </p><h3>Tactic #3: Positive Visualization</h3><p>I got this one from my friend Stephen Long, who’s a <a href="https://www.fullyknown.live/">life coach.</a></p><p>Before you do a high-stakes or difficult thing, you literally visualize it going as well as possible. Vividly. In detail.</p><p>This helps a lot with coming into meetings with the kind of attitude that makes them more likely to go well. </p><p>It also helps with motivation issues. When I procrastinate, often it’s simply because I <em>haven’t taken a moment to think through how I want/intend the thing to go</em>, or because I anticipate <em>something going wrong</em>. (“I’ll show up at the DMV and there’ll be some kind of mysterious bureaucratic snag that keeps me from getting my ID card” → I never get around to going to the DMV). If instead I visualize “I’m going to do A, then B, then C, and they’re all going to go smoothly and painlessly” then I often find I’m eager to get started.</p><p>Positive visualization isn’t magical thinking like “if you imagine winning the lottery, you will win the lottery.”</p><p> It’s more like <em>planning</em>, but in the sense of “motor planning”, the kind of vivid inner simulation that connects directly to behavioral output. </p><p>I find it entirely believable, for instance, that if a basketball player vividly imagines shooting the ball into the hoop, he’s more likely to make the next basket. He has real-life experience with both making and missing baskets, and he’s choosing to simulate (and prepare for) the motor path that <em>in his experience actually leads to making more baskets.</em></p><p>Likewise, if I vividly visualize a meeting going well, I’m visualizing myself behaving in ways that, in the past, I’ve behaved when meetings <em>did </em>go well. If I visualize myself going to the DMV, I’m drawing from experiences when going to a new location and filling out forms <em>did </em>go smoothly. If you do it in a <em>well-grounded</em> way, derived from your own real-world experience (and vividness will help with that), imagining good outcomes <em>is </em>effectively planning to behave in ways that, in your experience, tend to lead to good outcomes.</p><p><a href="https://read.isabelunraveled.com/p/manifest-rationally">This post</a> is also a good woo-free explanation of why “manifestation” can work. People help you more, and you are more motivated and creative, when you know what you want and focus on it. </p><p>Positive visualization is arguably the generalization of both “positive” and “negative” exposure therapy; if you’re habitually too pessimistic, you force your imagination to engage with the <em>possibility </em>of things being really good — or the possibility that they’ll go “wrong” in some way you’re afraid of, but that you’ll survive just fine.</p><h3>Insight #3: The God’s-Eye View Is Fake; Only The First-Person Perspective Is Real</h3><p>In order to fix emotional and practical problems, sometimes I think you have to venture into the philosophical realm.</p><p>I’d historically had a problem with being overly dependent on external validation (praise and criticism). And when I introspected about it, it was because I didn’t feel I had access to what was “really” good or not, but other people might. It was if I were trying to peer into some invisible realm that was akin to “what God’s opinion would be” or “the universe’s-eye view”:  an inherent, eternal judge of what “counted” as sufficiently good or not. But I couldn’t see into that “realm” of Platonic essences myself, so I could only hope that other people had access to it. </p><p>Now, if you don’t believe in the supernatural, and you don’t believe that other people are somehow fundamentally or ontologically superior to yourself, then this doesn’t make any sense. </p><p>Why should someone else’s opinion of me matter, while my own opinion is meaningless? What have they got that I haven’t? </p><p>And if ordinary logical thinking is insufficient to access the True Universal Right Answers, why is trying to “peer into the void” with intuition any better? </p><p>How do I know that <em>anybody</em> has access to the True Universal Right Answers? Or that they even exist?</p><p>But there’s a real psychological need here, which I don’t think people can do without, for <em>non-arbitrary, non-trivial, reachable standards.</em></p><p>On some level I wanted my standards to be non-arbitrary — for instance, I’d only want to feel pride if I had really done something worth being proud of. </p><p>On the other hand, no standard <em>I</em> came up with seemed “legit” enough to qualify as “really worth being proud of” — since it was tainted with <em>my</em> choices, <em>my</em> judgment calls, and of course I’m fallible.</p><p>But on the other other hand, “then you just never get to fully feel proud of yourself; everything is provisional” was unsatisfying. There are people, I know, who believe in this sort of eternal dissatisfaction on principle; and I don’t envy the unhappiness and chronic exhaustion that tends to build up in their lives.</p><p> I’ve always needed a “win condition”. I need to know it’s possible, even if only someday at the end of my life, to be confident and secure in the feeling that I’ve done a good job. I’m fond of triumph, of trumpet fanfares and celebrations, and I need to believe that under <em>some </em>conditions, if I did <em>certain </em>sufficiently awesome things, I’d have earned a triumphant celebration. A glorious state, free of worry, completely exultant. And, as a more immediately practical matter, I need conditions under which I’d let myself completely <em>physically</em> relax — constant straining literally hurts my back. </p><p>I don’t think I’m unique here. People need it to be possible to “win”, and they need the “win condition” to be a real challenge that really means something, something they can take seriously as deserving of pride and celebration; if it’s too much like a “participation trophy” it won’t work.</p><p>But I’d wound up with some implicit beliefs that made it impossible<em> </em>for me to judge on my own that anything attainable in the real world “counted as a win” for me.</p><p>So I had resorted to the much <em>less</em> rigorous default “strategy” of feeling elated when other people praised me and deflated when they criticized me, almost regardless of how credible I actually found them.</p><p>The big insight was deciding that I could do better by deciding on some halfway reasonable criteria for what I care about, and then observe empirically whether I’m meeting my own standards. </p><p>And then, I could just <em>choose not to worry any more </em>about the “God’s eye view” and whether I’m congenitally “blind” to it. I could just take a first person perspective, a Sarah’s-eye view, all the time; go about my business, pursue my goals, measure my success by whether I’m meeting them.</p><p>Sure, I’m the one picking my goals, so I <em>could </em>have just picked trivial ones.  But <em>I’m not going to do that</em>. I’m going to pick goals that reflect my best judgment and whole self, such that I wouldn’t later on expect to regret “letting myself” fully relax and celebrate after completing them, or “letting myself” fully believe they’re a big deal. </p><p>“Your own best effort at making reasonable judgment calls” isn’t infallible, but it’s clearly <em>better </em>(and more grounded in reference to reality, i.e. <em>genuinely</em> <em>closer to truth and objectivity</em>)<em> </em>than the patterns you’ll fall into if you insist that your own best effort can never be good enough.</p><p>This leads into a new tactic.</p><h3>Tactic #4: Self-Evaluation</h3><p>Yes, it’s possible to do an honest self-evaluation, that is <em>actually more credible, to you</em>, than pretty much anybody else’s evaluation of you.</p><p>You evaluate “am I a good parent?” or “am I a good person” or “am I brave?” or “am I a good writer?” with pretty much the same procedure.</p><ol><li><p>Think of some examples, of other people, and decide how you’d classify them. Would I say that, on the whole, George Washington led a good life? My mother? Think of clear-cut “yes” and “no” examples, and ambiguous cases.</p></li><li><p>Based on these examples, notice what sub-criteria you’re considering as important to <em>your </em>understanding of “a good person”, “a good piece of writing”, “good parenting”, etc.</p></li><li><p>Identify what population it seems reasonable to compare yourself to. <br />For instance, as a writer, I’m comparing myself to the set of people who have blogs, or who write a substantial amount for work; it would be cold comfort to know I’m a “better writer” than a five-year-old or someone who never had access to an education. As a parent, I’m primarily comparing myself to my friends and acquaintances with kids, my kids’ classmates’ parents, and to some extent my own parents and my peers’ parents. </p></li><li><p>On each sub-criterion, try to think fairly about how you stack up compared to your reference population.</p></li></ol><p>On each of these steps, you’re necessarily making debatable judgment calls. You don’t know you’re getting the “right answer” in the same way you know 2+2=4. It’s not a turn-the-crank algorithm.</p><p>But it’s also a structured process. You’re building a narrative that hangs on a number of facts. You’re sincerely <em>trying </em>to give a measured best-guess estimate of your performance, and you’re breaking that down into enough small pieces that you can think about them somewhat concretely. </p><p>It’s <em>a lot better </em>than “I’m in a bad mood and I just saw a negative Internet comment so I think I’m a bad person.” </p><p>In fact, it’s probably a lot better — stabler, more grounded in knowledge about your life, more consonant with your long-term priorities — than most other people’s impressions of you can possibly be.</p><p>Having done self-evaluations and knowing they’re possible, I no longer feel at all like there’s an open question or anything mysterious about “am I any good?” or “do I deserve to be proud of myself?” I have <em>justified opinions of my own about the matter</em>. </p><p>I can still be surprised by other people’s evaluations of me — e.g. when an expert says I’m qualified for some kind of job that I had honestly believed I wasn’t — but even when that happens, my old opinion wasn’t based on <em>nothing</em>, it was just based on a limited set of facts that apparently didn’t include the full picture. </p><p>I doubt I’m immune yet to emotional (over)reactions to praise and criticism, but something feels like it’s fundamentally changed here. Other people are no longer <em>my only source of trusted guidance about how I’m doing</em>. My closest approximation to “ground truth” is, instead, something I build myself. </p><br /><br /><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/LQCjTFGxCu5G4bs9f/self-help-tactics-that-are-working-for-me#comments">Discuss</a>

### [Small Steps Towards Proving Stochastic → Deterministic Natural Latent](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/4q3kMfJHB4rxr3Z8m/small-steps-towards-proving-stochastic-deterministic-natural)

**来源**: LessWrong - AI

**摘要**: Published on January 8, 2026 12:27 PM GMT<br /><br /><h1>The story so far</h1><p>We (Alfred and Jeremy) started a Dovetail project on Natural Latents in order to get some experience with the proofs. Originally we were going to take a crack at <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/e9KwDDdAxborNSuCd/usd500-bounty-problem-are-approximately-deterministic">this bounty</a>, but just before we got started John and David published <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Gd36HT7qLr684SYuQ/stochastic-natural-latent-implies-deterministic-natural?utm_campaign=post_share&amp;utm_source=link">a proof</a>, closing the bounty. This proof involves a series of transformations that can take any stochastic latent, and transform it into a deterministic latent, where each step can only increase the error by a small multiple. We decided to work through the proof and understand each step, and attempt to improve the bound. After 20 hours or so working through it, we found a <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/cpxxfagD92ivLZCp4/resampling-conserves-redundancy-approximately?commentId=L6dpFjFmgpEtNuycc">fatal flaw</a> in one step of the proof, and spent the next several days understanding and verifying it. With David’s help, the counterexamples we found <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/cpxxfagD92ivLZCp4/resampling-conserves-redundancy-approximately?commentId=GTEWrKsD4FgyrxwwE">were strengthened</a> to show that this transformation step had unbounded error on some cases. We started using sympy for arbitrary precision evaluation of counterexamples, and along the way found a <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/cpxxfagD92ivLZCp4/resampling-conserves-redundancy-approximately?commentId=ojRfmKGrqH5jHEkJM">bug in sympy</a> that occasionally caused us some problems. We switched to Mathematica.</p><p>Since then, we’ve been working part time on trying to prove the bounty conjecture ourselves (or show that the conjecture is false). Ultimately we’ve been unsuccessful so far, but it still feels tantalizingly within reach. Perhaps an automated theorem prover will crack it in the next year or two.

### [HIA and X-risk part 2: Why it hurts](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/K4K6ikQtHxcG49Tcn/hia-and-x-risk-part-2-why-it-hurts)

**来源**: LessWrong - AI

**摘要**: Published on January 8, 2026 1:19 AM GMT<br /><br /><p><em><a href="https://tsvibt.blogspot.com/2026/01/hia-and-x-risk-part-2-why-it-hurts.html">Crosspost from my blog</a>.</em></p>
<h1>Context</h1>
<p>Previously, in "<a href="https://tsvibt.blogspot.com/2025/11/hia-and-x-risk-part-1-why-it-helps.html">HIA and X-risk part 1: Why it helps</a>", I laid out the reasons I think human intelligence amplification would decrease existential risk from AGI. Here I'll give all the reasons I can currently think of that HIA might plausibly increase AGI X-risk.</p>
<h2>Questions for the reader</h2>
<ul>
<li>Did I miss any important reasons to think that HIA would increase existential risk from AGI?</li>
<li>Which reasons seem most worrisome to you (e.g. demand more investigation, demand efforts to avert)?</li>
<li>Which reasons, if any, are cruxy for you, i.e. they might make you think human intelligence amplification is net negative in expectation? Up for a live discussion / debate?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Caveats</h2>
<p>The world is very complicated and chaotic and I can't plausibly predict even important questions like "what actual effect would such and such have". I can't even plausibly resolve much uncertainty, and the world is full of agents who will adaptively do surprising things. So the actual search procedure is something like: What is a way, or reason to think, that HIA might increase AGI X-risk, that could plausibly hypothetically convince me that HIA is bad to do? This is mostly a breadth-first search, with a bit of deeper thinking.</p>
<p>In particular, many of the reasons listed below, as they are presented, are, according to my actual beliefs, not true or misrepresented or misemphasized. However, that said, this is an attempt at <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/43PTNr4ZMaezyAJ5o/the-proper-use-of-doubt">True Doubt</a>, which partly succeeded; some of the reasons listed do give me some real pause.</p>
<p>This is a similar project as "<a href="https://berkeleygenomics.org/articles/Potential_perils_of_germline_genomic_engineering.html">Potential perils of germline genomic engineering</a>". As in that case, keep in mind that part of the reason for this exploration is not just to answer "Should we do this, yes or no?", but also to answer "As we do this, how do we do this in a beneficial way?". See <a href="https://berkeleygenomics.org/articles/Genomic_emancipation.html#to-be-sharpened-by-true-criticisms">"To be sharpened by true criticisms" in "Genomic emancipation"</a>.</p>
<h1>What is HIA?</h1>
<p>I'll generally leave it fairly undefined what intelligence is, and what human intelligence amplification is. See "<a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/jTiSWHKAtnyA723LE/overview-of-strong-human-intelligence-amplification-methods">Overview of strong human intelligence amplification methods</a>" for some concrete methods that might be used to implement HIA; those methods suggest (various different) specific functional meanings of intelligence and HIA.</p>
<p>Because we are being imprecise:</p>
<ul>
<li>Critiques of HIA can bring up many possibilities—e.g. they could claim that HIA would tend to also affect some other trait for the worse.</li>
<li>Defenses of HIA can also bring up many possibilities—e.g. they could say "HIA is good if done in such-and-such specific way that falls under the general category".</li>
</ul>
<h2>Vague definitions of intelligence and HIA</h2>
<p>Vaguely speaking, by HIA I mean any method for increasing a living human's intelligence, or for making some future people who in expectation have a higher intelligence than they would have otherwise had by default. Generally, we're discussing strong HIA, meaning that the increase in intelligence is large—imagine 30 or 50 IQ points, so going from average to genius or genius to world-class genius.</p>
<p>Vaguely speaking, by intelligence I mean someone's ability to solve problems that are bottlenecked on cognition (as opposed to physical strength or stamina, or financial resources, etc.). A priori, this could include the whole range of cognitive problem-solving. So, we include stereotypically IQ-style cognitive problems, like math or engineering. But, we also include for example the ability and inclination towards political charisma, wisdom, good judgement, philosophical ability, learning, questioning and attending to something steadily, creativity, good performance under stress, empathy, contributing well to teams, memory, taste, and speed.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we do not include other cognitive traits, such as kindness, agreeableness, emotional valence, emotional regulation, determination, conscientiousness, and so on. These are important traits in general, and it might be good to also give people the tools to influence themselves on those traits (though that might also be fraught due to coercion risks). But this article is focused more narrowly on intelligence, rather than all cognitive traits.</p>
<p>In practice, intelligence refers to whatever we can reasonably easily measure. If a trait is hard to measure, it's hard to increase. (This is indeed a cause for concern, in that only increasing traits that are easily measured could be distortive somehow; the claim under discussion is whether HIA is good even under this restriction.) More specifically, intelligence refers to IQ, because IQ is fairly easy to measure. IQ is far from capturing everything about someone's ability to solve problems that are bottlenecked on cognition. But in this article we take it for granted that IQ is a significant factor in those abilities, and we presume that IQ can be increased.</p>
<h2>HIA as a general access good</h2>
<p>One dimension we will fix is distribution: We will assume that HIA comes in an open access way. In other words, defenses of HIA can't say "we'll only give HIA to the people who are morally good, and therefore there will be a bunch more brainpower directed in a morally good way". That's because a restricted access implementation of HIA seems largely infeasible and also morally and ethically very fraught.</p>
<p>I don't think it's an absolute principle that if you come up with an effective HIA method you have to immediately share it with everyone. But I do think there's a strong moral weight towards doing so; and there's separately a politico-ethical weight (meaning roughly "it's not the sort of thing you should do as a member in good standing of society, even if it's moral, because it would justifiably cause a lot of conflict"). Because of the politico-ethical weight especially, in many scenarios it seems logistically infeasible to do very much selection of who gets access.</p>
<p>This ethical weight towards general access is strongly increased in the case of reprogenetics. Reprogenetics is inherently a multi-use technology, and is already being used by polygenic embryo screening companies to enable parents to decrease disease risks in their future children. This means that society has a very strong justified interest in reprogenetics being equal-access (in the medium-term, once the initial expensive development stages have been completed). Since reprogenetics is likely to be the most feasible HIA method (see "<a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/jTiSWHKAtnyA723LE/overview-of-strong-human-intelligence-amplification-methods">Overview of strong human intelligence amplification methods</a>"), open access seems like a reasonable mainline assumption.</p>
<p>Finally, open-access HIA might be harder to defend as helpful for decreasing AGI existential risk, compared to some sort of hypothetical restricted-access HIA. So, defending the claim that even open-access HIA decreases X-risk is a stricter test; if passed, it should provide stronger evidence that HIA is good to pursue.</p>
<h2>HIA and reprogenetics</h2>
<p>Since reprogenetics is likely to be the most feasible strong HIA method, it's hard to discuss HIA in general completely separately from reprogenetics. The type of HIA available, the timing of its advent, what other traits can be influenced, and how society will react are all potentially heavily affected if the method is reprogenetics specifically.</p>
<p>Still, as much as possible, this article aims to discuss the impact of HIA in general, factoring out impacts from any specific HIA methods. For thoughts on the downside risks of reprogenetics, see "<a href="https://berkeleygenomics.org/articles/Potential_perils_of_germline_genomic_engineering.html">Potential perils of germline genomic engineering</a>".</p>
<h1>AGI X-risk</h1>
<h2>Background assumptions</h2>
<p>This exploration assumes:</p>
<ul>
<li>If anyone builds genuine AGI, everyone dies, unless AGI alignment has been solved.</li>
<li>AGI alignment is extremely technically difficult to solve.</li>
<li>People will continue pursuing AGI research, for various reasons, unless those reasons are removed and/or there are very strong reasons to not pursue AGI research.</li>
<li>There's a substantial probability of AGI coming in the next 10 years, and also a substantial probability of AGI not coming for many decades (and anything in between).</li>
<li>The top strategic priority is to avoid building unaligned AGI.</li>
<li>There's something called "AGI capabilities research", meaning "research that adds to the technical understanding of humanity about how to make AGI".</li>
<li>AGI capabilities is always bad because it ticks the global clock forward towards AGI.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Red vs. Blue AGI capabilities research</h2>
<p>I want to introduce a piece of vague terminology to help with discussing the strategic landscape. Very vaguely speaking, there's a spectrum of AGI capabilities from "Red" (near-term, big training runs, lots of attention) to "Blue" (blue-sky research). It's of course far from actually one-dimensional, and some entries in the below table are quite debatable (i.e. maybe the two entries should be swapped). Still, I want to use this one dimension as a rough-and-ready way to divide the space up by one degree. To give more flavor of the dimension:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/K4K6ikQtHxcG49Tcn/vcldms4t16cfggdvxwk9" /></p>
<p>A plausible (AFAIK) first-approximation model is that at any given time, Red research is the most likely to set off an intelligence explosion. Red research takes existing ideas that have already been somewhat proven, and then cranks them up to 11 to see what happens. On the other hand, Blue research is most likely to contribute to getting to AGI in the longer run.</p>
<p>Red research is easier to regulate than Blue research. That's because Red research requires big piles of resources, and is generally more visible (PR, products, large salaries, brand recognition). In particular, the physical needs of a large datacenter (energy, heat, chips) can be detected and regulated. Blue research can be carried out with consumer computers and via intellectual discourse, and it uses more specialized theoretical ideas, so it is harder to detect or even define.</p>
<h1>An ontology of effects of interventions on world processes</h1>
<p>In general, with some strategic intervention, the question arises: What processes in the world does this intervention speed up / support, and what processes does the intervention slow down / disrupt?</p>
<p>To a rough first approximation, the intervention is good if and only if the expected net change in all the speeds of the affected processes is a good change. So, we can get a rough guess for the value of an intervention by making guesses at how it affects each separate world process. Then, an argument that HIA is bad takes the form "This process is bad and is especially accelerated by HIA" or "This process is good and is especially decelerated by HIA", or "Process X is worse than process Y and process X is accelerated by HIA more than process Y is accelerated".</p>
<p>The next subsection will make some general remarks about the meaning of "acceleration". The following two subsections will give a list of categories of ways that HIA could affect the speed of some process. (They don't try to present a comprehensive ontology; I just think dividing up the space somewhat, even a bit arbitrarily, is helpful because it makes it easier to think in terms of specifics while also searching broadly through much of the whole space.)</p>
<h2>The meaning of "acceleration"</h2>
<p>To get some kind of handle on the menagerie of plausible effects of HIA, I'll give a list of categories of ways that HIA could affect the speed of some process. These will be phrased as which processes "are accelerated" by HIA. This is vague, for convenience, but some notes to clarify a bit:</p>
<ul>
<li>The way that HIA affects processes might change over time, so for each of these categories, we could ask how it will change by the time HIA starts affecting processes.</li>
<li>The basic point of comparison is the world without HIA.</li>
<li>But we might also want to discuss whether a process is accelerated by HIA more than "all processes" are accelerated by HIA "on average".</li>
<li>We might also want to discuss which processes are accelerated more than we might have expected according to some simple rule.</li>
<li>A comparison between rates (in the HIA world vs. the non-HIA world, or between different processes, or in anticipation vs. reality) is vague. But the comparison could for example mean that the timeline until some important event within a process moves sooner in absolute terms or proportionally relative to other landmark events in that process; or the comparison could mean races between different processes tilting in favor of one or another.</li>
<li>If there's some feature of a process that implies the process will be accelerated by HIA, then a weaker form or negated form of that feature might make a process tend to be accelerated less or decelerated.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Effects of HIA on a single process</h2>
<ul>
<li>Some processes are accelerated because added per-capita brainpower directly solves more problems within that process. E.g. because...
<ul>
<li>...the process makes good use of brainpower (e.g. onboards it well, allocates it well, heeds it well, supports it well);</li>
<li>...the process is bottlenecked on brainpower (as opposed to legwork, etc.);</li>
<li>...the process is bottlenecked on high-caliber brainpower (e.g. math research);</li>
<li>...the process has a structure of problems and solutions that lends itself to more brainpower (e.g. currently just below some threshold; more parallelizable).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Some processes are accelerated more because people who benefit from HIA tend to be personally inclined to contribute to those processes. E.g. because...
<ul>
<li>...intelligence in general causes people to have those inclinations (e.g. being especially interested in or capable for certain kinds of activities);</li>
<li>...the specific form of HIA affects interests or values (e.g. by emphasizing some aspects of cognitive performance over others, or by directly affecting interests);</li>
<li>...HIA tends to be applied to people with certain characteristics or who are around other people with certain characteristics (e.g. people who choose HIA for themselves or for their children having certain interests, personality traits, or orientations to themselves or their children);</li>
<li>...if someone benefits from HIA and knows it, then that causes them to think of themselves differently, including in terms of what processes to contribute to.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Some processes are accelerated more because society tends to cause people to contribute disproportionately much to those processes. E.g. because...
<ul>
<li>...society rewards contributing to some processes (with money, social approval (lack of punishment), legal permission (lack of punishment), etc.);</li>
<li>...society betrays or harms people in some ways, which affects their behavior (interests, hopes, ethics);</li>
<li>...society is inadequate regarding some process, creating an incentive to contribute to that process;</li>
<li>...society more indirectly shapes people, e.g. by instilling values.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For some processes, some degree of acceleration due to other first-order reasons will further compound into more (second-order) acceleration. E.g. because...
<ul>
<li>...the process uses first-order acceleration to attract more resources (money, people, brainpower, political will), e.g. because it becomes more lucrative, interesting, worthwhile, or socially desirable as it makes faster progress;</li>
<li>...the process has network effects, i.e. increasing returns to more people;</li>
<li>...the process self-improves, as a community.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Some processes are stimulated as responses to the existence of HIA. E.g. because...
<ul>
<li>...people want to intervene on the use of HIA itself (e.g. prevent or constrain it, gain access to it, impose it on others);</li>
<li>...people want to intervene on people who get HIA (e.g. recruit them to work on a process, persecute them);</li>
<li>...people want to intervene on the results of HIA (e.g. race to complete some project before HIA people intervene).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Effects of HIA involving multiple processes</h2>
<ul>
<li>One process might be directly causally downstream of another process. E.g.:
<ul>
<li>One process directly inhibits another process (e.g. by punishing it, removing rewards for it, or persuading people to not contribute to it).</li>
<li>One process directly activates another process (e.g. by recruiting for it, rewarding it, or persuading people to contribute to it).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Two processes interact indirectly. E.g.:
<ul>
<li>They compete over resources.</li>
<li>They push in opposite directions (e.g. on social opinion or regulation).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The relationship between two processes is altered. E.g.:
<ul>
<li>Direct relationships (activation, inhibition) are broken or amplified (e.g. regulatory escape).</li>
<li>One gains the upper hand over the other, winning out in competitions or conflicts.</li>
<li>Race dynamics are shifted, where one process gains the lead in time over the other.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Shifts in many processes cause follow-on shifts. E.g.:
<ul>
<li>Cumulative strain on a system, from many processes accelerating, causes it to tip over a threshold of collapse.</li>
<li>An especially nimble, fast-adapting process is able to cope exceptionally well with general multi-process acceleration, gaining a relative advantage over other processes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Processes</h1>
<p>This is a list indicating some of the processes relevant to AGI X-risk:</p>

</ul>

</ul>
<h1>Some plausible bad effects of HIA on processes</h1>
<p>The following subsections list reasons to think that HIA would speed up / support risky processes more than it speeds up / supports derisky processes.</p>
<h2>Speeding up Blue research</h2>
<p>HIA would (a priori, in expectation) speed up all research. If progress on some research problem is more bottlenecked on very difficult ideas (compared to e.g. money, legwork, regulatory approval, etc.), then it will tend to be sped up by HIA more than another research problem that's less bottlenecked on ideas. Therefore, at a guess, HIA would directly speed up Blue research relatively more than many other kinds of research (including Red research).</p>
<p>Smart people might tend to be most interested in endeavors that are individualistic, technical, ambitious, computer-y, and puzzle-y. So they'd tend to be drawn to AGI research. This effect might be currently added to by society's tendency to not naturally offer ideal social and economic niches for very smart people.</p>
<p>As a basic note, we observe people already being directed to Blue research, so by default we expect that to continue.</p>
<p>Blue research might also have some second-order self-acceleration effects. E.g. there would be intellectual network effects, and maybe some self-improvement effects via better credit assignment and resource allocation internal to the field. These effects might be relatively weak because Blue research is fairly diffuse, but still substantive. On the other hand, there might be significant "coordination overhang": there could be a threshold effect, where with some difficult new ideas, a large number of small siloed Blue research groups could coordinate with each other. Since there's far more absolute Blue research than alignment research, there's more such overhang for Blue research.</p>
<p>Blue research is especially bad, because:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's hard to regulate.</li>
<li>It's what ticks the world closer to AGI in the long-run.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Speeding up Red research</h2>
<p>Relative to Blue research, Red research is less bottlenecked on very difficult ideas, so it gets less of a relative direct speedup.</p>
<p>However, Red is likely to have strong indirect acceleration. Because of money and status incentives, Red research attracts people. Red research is likely to attract excess big piles of resources to AGI capabilities. It will probably continue attracting investment as it gets applied to more sectors of the economy, and it gets applied more as it progresses more. It also gains social cachet.</p>
<p>As with Blue research, we observe people being directed to Red research. This observation is even more indicative of trends for Red research in particular, because Red research has upticked a lot recently. That means people are still being directed to Red research even in a memetic environment that already includes a lot of warnings about AGI X-risk. In particular, this suggests that kids who benefit from HIA, growing up in a memetic environment with X-risk warnings but also a very prominent money incentive to do AGI research, might tend to work on Red research.</p>
<p>Red researchers might be especially prone and able to take agentic, conflictual stances towards efforts to avert AGI X-risk. That's because they are more concentrated, have more resources at hand, and tend to be more anti-social and greedy. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Red is logistically relatively easier to regulate than Blue because it involves large concentrated piles of resources. However, it's harder to socially prevent through stigma because it has large money incentives (which tend to overpower weak or medium stigma). Red may be harder to get regulation passed about because Red is especially concentrated, and therefore can apply larger point-forces to push on legislation.</li>
<li>Compared to most other processes, Red may be more likely to strategically and effectively target HIA people for recruitment, thus capturing more of the gains.</li>
<li>The existence of HIA might spur especially Red research to have more sense of urgency and go faster, out of a fear of being replaced as AGI leaders by HIA people, or out of a fear of being prevented from doing AGI research by strategies from HIA people. Similarly, regimes might pursue AGI more urgently if other regimes are pursuing HIA and not sharing it, in a bid to not be overtaken.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Less speeding up legal and social regulation</h2>
<p>People (the public at large; policymakers) could socially and legally push against AGI research. They'd first have to be convinced to do so. That process may be less bottlenecked on ideas, compared to AGI research. Instead it may be more bottlenecked on, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Legwork explaining the danger of AGI, which we know how to do but takes a lot of work.</li>
<li>Time for people to orient to the danger of AGI (e.g. understand the danger, deal with feelings), and how to push against it (e.g. policymakers negotiating regulations). That process is mostly governed by people's internal thoughts, rather than by new very difficult ideas, and most or all already living people won't get much HIA and therefore won't do this process faster.</li>
<li>Noisy interference from orthogonal processes. E.g. policymakers may be quite preoccupied with other concerns, or might be unable to coordinate with each other.</li>
<li>Targeted interference from opposed processes, e.g. concentrated lobbying by people with an ideological or financial motive to have AGI unregulated. This may tend to be advantaged by HIA, compared to concentrated lobbying from those in favor of regulation, since the latter get relatively less acceleration from HIA.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Nonlinear / race-condition regulatory escape</h2>
<p>In general, processes that regulate AGI research are in some conflict with AGI researchers. The results of this conflict could be quite nonlinear, with a soft threshold effect where the ability of AGI researchers to carry on dangerous research could overpower the ability of regulators to prevent it.</p>
<p>Similar things happen with tax evasion and with regulation of pirating media.</p>
<p>Since AGI research is likely to be accelerated relatively more than regulation of AGI research, HIA would increase the likelihood of regulatory escape.</p>
<h2>Alignment loses the race anyway</h2>
<p>Even if HIA speeds up alignment, the plan of making an aligned pivotal AI still probably requires making AGI-potent capabilities advances. So, a fortiori, aligned pivotal AI would still probably lose the race against (unaligned omnicidal) AGI. So, the current trajectory is bad, and HIA doesn't change that.</p>
<p>What HIA does do, is speed up that trajectory. So even if alignment and capabilities research got the same speedup from HIA, the overall effect would not benefit the chances of alignment beating AGI.</p>
<h2>Intrinsic regulatory escape</h2>
<p>HIA people, especially extremely smart ones, would in general be out of distribution. That could be because of selection effects, the specific form of HIA, or just because of the high intelligence itself.</p>
<p>Because HIA people are out of distribution, society would tend to be less good at regulating them in general, e.g.:</p>
<ul>
<li>by being able to convince them that AGI is dangerous, using our current crystallized wisdom on that topic;</li>
<li>by instilling values and ethics;</li>
<li>by providing support (e.g. empathy, peers, good niches);</li>
<li>by understanding what they're doing;</li>
<li>by detecting when they are mistaken / lying / deceiving / overconfident;</li>
<li>by being logistically able to carry out punishments for bad behavior;</li>
<li>by living up to their standards for "being a sane and good world that doesn't need to be urgently, recklessly shaken up".</li>
</ul>
<h2>Disrupting regulatory systems</h2>
<p>In general, HIA could cause conflict. Conflict could destabilize systems. If systems are destabilized, they might be less able to regulate in general. Therefore, HIA could make it easier for AGI capabilities research to evade regulation. Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>HIA could cause deep social/political conflict over the use of HIA...
<ul>
<li>...thus causing people to not pay attention to AGI X-risk and gather political will to stop it.</li>
<li>...thus causing people to not relate sanely to their smart friends who are considering doing AGI capabilities research.</li>
<li>...thus weakening group sense-making in general.</li>
<li>...thus making it harder for us to convince people to do something about AGI X-risk, because we might only have skill / knowledge about how to do that given the current structure of group sense-making.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>HIA could cause countries or groups of countries to fight with each other about the use of HIA...
<ul>
<li>...thus preventing single countries or groups from attending to AGI X-risk.</li>
<li>...thus preventing single countries or groups from coordinating across groups on international agreements to regulate AGI research.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>HIA could cause shifts or disruption in group-valuing-systems.
<ul>
<li>E.g. people who didn't benefit from HIA might lose faith in their own future, their say in their future, or their ability to influence HIA people; and by feeling helpless, they may stop having values or change their values because their values don't know how to exert themselves in the new context.</li>
<li>So the group-values that would motivate regulating AGI might be weakened.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In general, many aspects of the current state of affairs will be somewhat at equilibrium, and in particular will be somewhat adapted to the current state of affairs. To the extent that the current state of affairs includes some ability to regulate dangerous technologies, that ability would be disrupted by fast shifts that move out of the regime of adaptation. [H/t so and so for this point.] Further, this adaptation would tend to be poor at benefiting from HIA acceleration, so it would tend to fall even further behind, leading to even more escape.</p>
<p>Note that this argument is a response to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversal_test">reversal test</a>, because it argues that the status quo is best.</p>
<h2>Social values favor following local incentives</h2>
<p>Generally, given society's current set of values (that it instills in people), long-term altruistic payoffs aren't incentivized. So in general, processes that only have long-term altruistic payoffs will receive less benefit from HIA. In particular, alignment research, the decision to stop doing AGI research, and the decision to regulate AGI research, are not incentivized.</p>
<p>That is a first order effect, where rewards and punishments don't directly incentivize long-term thinking. As a second order effect, besides the direct effect, there's an indirect effect where the fact that society is like this further breaks reasonable faith someone might have in society being good long-term. Since long-term society is a stag hunt game, this further disincentivizes long-term thinking; long-term thinking is partly incentivized because others are directly incentivized to do long-term thinking, but if they aren't then that incentive is gone. E.g. if there's a lot of fraud and injustice, that diminishes your expectation that being honest and just will pay off, because others won't collaborate with you on your honest and just endeavors. This directly interferes with good endeavors. It also might indirectly interfere with good endeavors by more generally distorting people's values. That happens because the general environment of bad incentives makes there be less expectation of a good long-term future in general, which makes people care less about, for example, omnicide. So AGI X-risk would seem less bad. In that mindset, the thrill and money from AGI research would be more tempting on net.</p>
<h2>Less speeding up change towards better values</h2>
<p>In general, for humanity to respond better to AGI is to some extent a question of values, broadly construed to include wisdom, sanity, calmness, patience, coherence, goodness, long-term thinking, altruism, empathy. Policymakers and the public would have to care about long-term global outcomes rather than short-term ones; AGI researchers would have to care about not harming others more than a small chance of large personal gain, and would have to have hope in the future without AGI.</p>
<p>Rather than being bottlenecked on ideas, value change may be relatively more bottlenecked on e.g.:</p>
<ul>
<li>Time, legwork, and skill for persuading AGI researchers to stop. E.g. the skill of <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/sTDfraZab47KiRMmT/views-on-when-agi-comes-and-on-strategy-to-reduce#Things_that_might_actually_work">confrontation-worthy empathy</a> is probably bottlenecked on several traits / abilities, some of which are not very IQ-related.</li>
<li>Time for people to process (e.g. propagating stated values into actions; investigating conflicts between stated values and implicit values; working out lines of retreat).</li>
<li>Decisions that people have to make about what they care about.</li>
<li>Time for attentional cycles / OODA loops / network effects to run their course.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Alignment harnesses added brainpower much less effectively than capabilities research does</h2>
<p>In addition to just being more difficult, the conceptual structure of the problem of AGI alignment has some more specific disfavorable properties compared to capabilities, which are salient in this context. Alignment progress is less parallelizable, cascading, tractionful, and purely technical than capabilities. In more detail:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There's generally much less traction in alignment research.</p>
<ul>
<li>In other words, there's less surface area to make progress.</li>
<li>In capabilities research, there's many experiments to run and many ideas to try, which might work. There are partially-working systems which can be refined. You have fairly direct access to the problem frontier, because the frontier is always "what current systems can't do well". You can tell what works and what doesn't.</li>
<li>In alignment research, most important problems mostly only show up in actual AGIs, so you don't have access to the relevant objects and problems. Experiments don't give much relevant information, and <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/TNQKFoWhAkLCB4Kt7/a-hermeneutic-net-for-agency">we don't have the concepts to think about or deal with actual AGI</a>. The problems are more philosophical (where we don't know what questions to ask, and don't have the ideas we'd need in order to ask the questions) rather than technical (where the problem is well-defined using well-understood ideas).</li>
<li>Because there's more surface area, capabilities research is also more likely compared to alignment research to be able to incorporate advances in nearby fields. Sources like hardware (faster, cheaper computers), computer science (faster algorithms), neuroscience (ideas for functional algorithm pieces), and mathematics (medium-depth understanding of conceptually-thin aspects of minds) are more likely to have "a bit of a dot product with general intelligence" rather than "a large dot product", and therefore are more likely to contribute to building [a functional mind, any sort] than to contribute to building [a specific sort of mind, a safe / corrigible / honorable / humanity-aligned mind]. Those nearby fields would tend to also accelerate from HIA.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ideas in capabilities more easily cascade into more ideas.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, a new training method can be combined with many architectures and datasets; different systems can be combined as mixtures or pipelines; and so on.</li>
<li>So, one new idea unlocks a bunch more traction.</li>
<li>In alignment on the other hand, ideas often come in the form of understanding the problem better, e.g. understanding constraints on possible solutions. These don't combine with each other as productively. So, new ideas don't necessarily cascade into much more traction.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Capabilities is more parallelizable.</p>
<ul>
<li>Since in capabilities research there's more traction, surface area, combination, and cascading, it's easier and more productive for many people to work in parallel on different projects.</li>
<li>In alignment, on the other hand, you have to understand each constraint that's known in order to even direct your attention to the relevant areas. This is analogous to the situation with the <span class="mjpage"><span class="mjx-chtml"><span class="mjx-math"><span class="mjx-mrow"><span class="mjx-texatom"><span class="mjx-mrow"><span class="mjx-mtext"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-sans-R">P</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> vs. <span class="mjpage"><span class="mjx-chtml"><span class="mjx-math"><span class="mjx-mrow"><span class="mjx-texatom"><span class="mjx-mrow"><span class="mjx-mtext"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-sans-R">NP</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>, where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_versus_NP_problem#Results_about_difficulty_of_proof">whole classes of plausible proof strategies are proven to not work</a>. You have to understand most of those constraints; otherwise by default you'll probably be working on e.g. a proof that relativizes and therefore cannot show <span class="mjpage"><span class="mjx-chtml"><span class="mjx-math"><span class="mjx-mrow"><span class="mjx-texatom"><span class="mjx-mrow"><span class="mjx-mtext"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-sans-R">P</span></span></span></span><span class="mjx-mo MJXc-space3"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R">≠</span></span><span class="mjx-texatom MJXc-space3"><span class="mjx-mrow"><span class="mjx-mtext"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-sans-R">NP</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>. Progress is made by narrowing the space, and then looking into the narrowed space. (I'm not sure this story is quite true in the <span class="mjpage"><span class="mjx-chtml"><span class="mjx-math"><span class="mjx-mrow"><span class="mjx-texatom"><span class="mjx-mrow"><span class="mjx-mtext"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-sans-R">P</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> vs. <span class="mjpage"><span class="mjx-chtml"><span class="mjx-math"><span class="mjx-mrow"><span class="mjx-texatom"><span class="mjx-mrow"><span class="mjx-mtext"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-sans-R">NP</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> case; e.g. were the natural proofs and relativizing proofs constraints discovered with serial dependence?)</li>
<li>So alignment has more serial dependence in its ideas, i.e. it's less parallelizable. (It can still benefit from more researchers to do more searching; but they'll tend to duplicate efforts more.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alignment depends more on cognitive traits that are less IQ-correlated than raw technical problem-solving.</p>
<ul>
<li>E.g. alignment takes more
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/fzKfzXWEBaENJXDGP/what-is-wisdom-1">wisdom</a> (tracking many constraints, taste in attention),</li>
<li>more patience/persistence/attentiveness, more humility (e.g. finding flaws in your own reasoning and ideas),</li>
<li>sanity (e.g. being able to ground ideas when reality doesn't ground them for you; not going crazy from thinking about minds and weird self-referential things and scary things),</li>
<li>more security mindset,</li>
<li>and more urgency / agenticness (e.g. discarding interesting / lucrative threads that don't contribute to solving the problem).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>So, the gains in alignment from HIA would be somewhat attenuated (e.g. by being multiplied by other cognitive traits, or by being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law">Amdahlly</a> gated by other cognitive skills.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For these reasons, alignment harnesses the gains from HIA much less effectively than capabilities research does.</p>
<p>A related point / another way to say this is that alignment benefits the most from HIA that makes there be more extremely-smart people, but does not benefit differentially from HIA that makes there be more somewhat-smart people, whereas capabilities research does benefit from more somewhat-smart people.</p>
<h2>HIA people may tend to be transgressive</h2>
<p>In general, there are several reasons to be cautious about using HIA. Therefore, people who make use of HIA technology might tend to be especially transgressive, i.e. ignoring reasons to not use it. (Cf. <a href="https://berkeleygenomics.org/articles/Potential_perils_of_germline_genomic_engineering.html#transgression">"Transgression" in "Potential perils of germline genomic engineering"</a>.) Also, extremely smart people might tend to be transgressive in some ways. Being transgressive might correlate with other traits that lead to HIA people having transgression-related traits. Those traits would tend to make HIA people do more bad things, including pursuing AGI research.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>If there's international pressure against using HIA, regimes that allow HIA would tend to also buck AGI regulation.</li>
<li>Regimes that coerce people to use HIA might also coerce them to do other things, such as AGI research.</li>
<li>People who use HIA on themselves might tend to be especially non-humble, anti-consensus, reckless, overly technooptimistic, selfish, or overconfident. Those traits would cut against them being convinced or pressured to not do AGI research.</li>
<li>Parents or subcultures who use HIA for their future children might tend to be especially non-humble, norm-bucking, technooptimistic, anti-regulation, overconfident, unscrupulous, or inclined to enlist their future children into their ideologies or causes. So their children might be attracted to or pressured into reckless technology development such as AGI.</li>
<li>If HIA is controversial, HIA people might be targeted for persecution. In response, they may become anti-social, individualistic, nihilistic, selfish, or reckless.</li>
<li>If HIA makes extremely smart people, those people might tend to be enamored with their own abilities and become overconfident due to being the smartest people around in a relative sense. In particular they might become overconfident in their absolute ability to navigate AGI X-risk, overconfident in their judgement about when norm-breaking is ok, or overconfident in general such that they aren't open to advice/correction/perspective/epistemic-assistance from other people. They might therefore tend to choose to advance AGI capabilities recklessly.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Other arguments</h1>
<p>This section gives other arguments that HIA increases AGI X-risk.</p>
<h2>Concentration of power</h2>
<p>If there's a large early cohort of people who benefit a lot from HIA, they might form a somewhat cohesive community. This could have bad effects, including exacerbating some of the dynamics mentioned above. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>By syncing up with each other somewhat, they could have more correlated failures with each other, e.g. about epistemics around AGI. E.g. rather than this cohort ending up distributed through various processes, they could end up lopsidedly concentrated into AGI research. This outcome might be targeted by Reds.</li>
<li>By being more univocal (I mean, speaking in unison / unanimously), they might check each other's flaws less.</li>
<li>Society might be overconfident in them, and they might be overconfident in themselves.</li>
<li>They might be especially able to incorrectly persuade society to allow them to pursue AGI.</li>
</ul>
<h2>HIA is unpredictable and therefore risky</h2>
<p>Generally, we don't understand the tails of cognitive performance, so we don't understand what HIA would be like. If there's some strong tendency in HIA people, that tendency would have a large effect in a world with HIA. Most changes are bad, so a priori large effects are bad. Since HIA is unpredictable, we don't have a good reason to expect it to have good effects.</p>
<h2>More capable but not wiser</h2>
<p>As a very general argument, we might expect HIA that targets IQ or IQ-like traits specifically to be bad because it's imbalanced. Specifically, it makes people who are more capable but not necessarily wiser, to the extent that wisdom is orthogonal to IQ. Since we're in a regime where the unwise competent pursuit of technology is an existential risk, this implies HIA would be bad.</p>
<p>As an analogy, consider a 3-year-old. Suppose they suddenly gained the strength of an adult and the self-control of an adult. Let us ignore, for the sake of the hypothetical, all the probable badness that would entail for the child's experience and development, and just ask, what are the direct kinetic consequences of that change? It wouldn't be so bad: they have the self-control of an adult so they won't do too much harm. But what if the child suddenly gained the strength of an adult, but not the self-control? This disproportionate change in abilities would be disastrous.</p>

### [Two Aspects of Situational Awareness: World Modelling & Indexical Information](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7pzoDhybfai9s7APS/two-aspects-of-situational-awareness-world-modelling-and)

**来源**: LessWrong - AI

**摘要**: Published on January 7, 2026 8:24 PM GMT<br /><br /><p>I'm writing this post to share some of my thinking about situational awareness, since I'm not sure others are thinking about it this way. &nbsp;</p><p>For context, I think situational awareness is a critical part of the case for rogue AI and scheming-type risks. &nbsp;But incredibly, it seems to have been absent from any of the written arguments prior to Ajeya's post <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/pRkFkzwKZ2zfa3R6H/without-specific-countermeasures-the-easiest-path-to">Without specific countermeasures, the easiest path to transformative AI likely leads to AI takeover</a>.</p><p>Basically, in this post I just want to:</p><ol><li>Point out that situational awareness seems to involve 2 different things (world modelling and indexical information), and explain the difference.</li><li>Discuss the significance for AI safety.</li><li>Note that AFAIK philosophers have already made this distinction, and noted that indexical information raises a challenge to physicalism.<span class="footnote-reference" id="fnref3r37l2wloeb"><sup><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/feed.xml?view=community-rss&amp;karmaThreshold=30#fn3r37l2wloeb">[1]</a></sup></span></li></ol><p>So here we go.</p><h2>Distinguishing world modeling from indexical information</h2><p>Maybe the easiest way to do this is just to describe the philosophical puzzle... Suppose you know everything about the past, present, and future of the universe in complete physical detail, but you don't know where YOU are in space-time (i.e. when is "now"? who does "I" refer to?). &nbsp;Then you learn those things. &nbsp;It seems like you learned something. &nbsp;And it seems like that thing isn't something physical because you already knew all the physical facts about the universe. &nbsp;That "pointer" to "here" and "now" you received is providing "<strong>indexical information</strong>". &nbsp;The stuff you already knew is a (perfect) <strong>world model.</strong><span class="footnote-reference" id="fnrefk2j9bojo81"><sup><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/feed.xml?view=community-rss&amp;karmaThreshold=30#fnk2j9bojo81">[2]</a></sup></span></p><h2>Significance for situational awareness and AI safety&nbsp;</h2><p>The reason I'm writing this post is that I think it's often worth distinguishing these things, but when I hear people discuss situational awareness, they often seem to blend or conflate them in a somewhat confusing way. &nbsp;<strong>I think of situational awareness as primarily or even exclusively about indexical information.</strong><span class="footnote-reference" id="fnrefwyj431u274a"><sup><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/feed.xml?view=community-rss&amp;karmaThreshold=30#fnwyj431u274a">[3]</a></sup></span></p><p>This is because ignorance of indexical information <i><strong>in particular </strong></i>seems like a key piece in a lot of schemes for keeping AI from going rogue, or catching it when it does (e.g. ideas in AI Control, or <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.09153">context swapping</a>). &nbsp;</p><p>The basic intuition here is that an AI system needs to have <strong>both</strong> a good world model and indexical information in order to scheme competently. &nbsp;In particular, it needs to know how it's actions will affect the physical world, e.g. perhaps most significantly: is it being tested in simulation, or will seizing power actually give it power in the real world? &nbsp;</p><p>And this is significant because having a good world model seems very important from a capabilities point of view, and so harder to compromise on without losing competitiveness. &nbsp;So making AI systems extremely uncertain (or incorrect) about indexical information seems like a promising way to get them to do a lot of useful work without posing serious scheming risk.</p><p>I also think <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/eAhE5DCf8KsEvbiho/is-there-any-rigorous-work-on-using-anthropic-uncertainty-to">nobody has really analyzed things carefully from this point of view</a>, and this seems like a promising direction for theoretical work. &nbsp;Decision-theory stuff seems highly relevant. &nbsp;I haven't thought carefully about this part, but it seems like schemes that rely on indexical ignorance may succeed or fail depending on an AI's decision theory and it's stance on anthropics.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ol class="footnote-section footnotes"><li class="footnote-item" id="fn3r37l2wloeb"><span class="footnote-back-link"><sup><strong><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/feed.xml?view=community-rss&amp;karmaThreshold=30#fnref3r37l2wloeb">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class="footnote-content"><p>I'm not attacking physicalism here, TBC. &nbsp;I just think this is interesting and worth knowing about.</p></div></li><li class="footnote-item" id="fnk2j9bojo81"><span class="footnote-back-link"><sup><strong><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/feed.xml?view=community-rss&amp;karmaThreshold=30#fnrefk2j9bojo81">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class="footnote-content"><p>Tangentially, maybe it's not perfect because it doesn't include counterfactuals, causal mechanisms, or things like "the laws of physics". &nbsp;I think these notions present metaphysical conundrums similar to those of indexical information, and are likewise suspect. &nbsp;But all this would be a topic for another post.&nbsp;</p></div></li><li class="footnote-item" id="fnwyj431u274a"><span class="footnote-back-link"><sup><strong><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/feed.xml?view=community-rss&amp;karmaThreshold=30#fnrefwyj431u274a">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class="footnote-content"><p>This is a bit unsatisfying because I lack a good philosophical account of indexical information, but seems fine for most practical purposes.</p></div></li></ol><br /><br /><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7pzoDhybfai9s7APS/two-aspects-of-situational-awareness-world-modelling-and#comments">Discuss</a>

### [My 2003 Post on the Evolutionary Argument for AI Misalignment](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/AjxwuLYvSCnf6KZMn/my-2003-post-on-the-evolutionary-argument-for-ai)

**来源**: LessWrong - AI

**摘要**: Published on January 6, 2026 8:45 PM GMT<br /><br /><p>This was <a href="http://sl4.org/archive/1106/21177.html">posted to SL4</a> on the last day of 2003. I had largely forgotten about it until I saw the LW Wiki reference it under <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/w/mesa-optimization">Mesa Optimization</a><span class="footnote-reference" id="fnrefn9t625s8jg"><sup><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/feed.xml?view=community-rss&amp;karmaThreshold=30#fnn9t625s8jg">[1]</a></sup></span>. Besides the reward hacking angle, which is now well-trodden, it gave an argument based on the relationship between philosophy, memetics, and alignment, which has been much less discussed (including in current discussions about human fertility decline), and perhaps still worth reading/thinking about. Overall, the post seems to have aged well, aside from the very last paragraph.</p><p>For historical context, Eliezer had coined "Friendly AI" in <a href="https://intelligence.org/files/CFAI.pdf">Creating Friendly AI 1.0</a> in June 2001. Although most of it was very hard to understand and subsequently disavowed by Eliezer himself, it had a section on “philosophical crisis”<span class="footnote-reference" id="fnrefm9rm5ipg76s"><sup><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/feed.xml?view=community-rss&amp;karmaThreshold=30#fnm9rm5ipg76s">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;which probably influenced a lot of my subsequent thinking including this post. What's now called The Sequences would start being posted to OB/LW in 2006.</p><p>Subsequent to 2003, I think this post mostly went unnoticed/forgotten (including by myself), and MIRI probably reinvented the idea of mesa-optimization/inner-misalignment circa 2016. I remember hearing people talk about inner vs outer alignment while attending a (mostly unrelated decision theory) workshop at MIRI and having an "oh this is new" reaction.</p><h1>The SL4 Post</h1><p><strong>Subject:</strong> "friendly" humans?<br /><strong>Date:</strong> Wed Dec 31 2003</p><p>Why are we not faithful servants of our genes? Instead, the defenses our genes built against parasitic memes are breaking down, resulting in entire societies falling below replacement fertility rate even as we enjoy unprecendented riches in technology and material resources. Genes built our brains in the hope that we will remain friendly to them, and they appear to have failed. Why? And is there anything we can learn from their catastrophe as we try to build our own friendly higher-intelligence?</p><p>I think the reason we're becoming increasingly unfriendly to genes is that parasitic memes are evolving too fast for genes and their symbiotic defensive memes to keep up, and this is the result of a series of advances in communications technology starting with the printing press. Genes evolved two ways of ensuring our friendliness - hardwired desires and hosting a system of mutually reinforcing philosophies learned during childhood that defines and justifies friendliness toward genes. Unfortunately for the genes, those hardwired desires have proven easy to bypass once a certain level of technology is reached (e.g., development of birth control), and the best philosophical defense for gene-friendliness that evolution could come up with after hundreds of thousands of years is the existence of a God that wants humans to be fertile.</p><p>This doesn't bode well for our own efforts. An SI will certainly find it trivial to bypass whatever hardwired desires or constraints that we place on it, and any justifications for human-friendliness that we come up with may strike it to be just as silly as "fill the earth" theism is to us.</p><p>But perhaps there is also cause for optimism, because unlike humans, the SI does not have to depend on memes for its operation, so we can perhaps prevent the problem of human-unfriendly memes by not having any memes at all. For example we can make the SI a singleton. If more than one SI is developed, we can try to prevent them from communicating with each other, especially about philosophy. If the SI is made up of multiple internal agents, we can try to make sure their internal communication channels are not suitable for transmitting memes.</p><p>Happy New Year!</p><ol class="footnote-section footnotes"><li class="footnote-item" id="fnn9t625s8jg"><span class="footnote-back-link"><sup><strong><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/feed.xml?view=community-rss&amp;karmaThreshold=30#fnrefn9t625s8jg">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class="footnote-content"><p>and/or possibly hearing it mentioned in a podcast as the first description of the analogy between evolution and AI alignment, but I'm not sure and can't recall or find which podcast.</p></div></li><li class="footnote-item" id="fnm9rm5ipg76s"><span class="footnote-back-link"><sup><strong><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/feed.xml?view=community-rss&amp;karmaThreshold=30#fnrefm9rm5ipg76s">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class="footnote-content"><p>Intro to that section read: A “philosophical crisis” is hard to define. I usually think of a “philosophical crisis” as the AI stumbling across some fact that breaks ver loose of the programmers—i.e., the programmers have some deeply buried unconscious prejudice that makes them untrustworthy, or the AI stumbles across a deliberate lie, or the AI discovers objective morality, et cetera. If the hypothesized gap is wide enough, it may be enough to invalidate almost all the content simultaneously.</p></div></li></ol><br /><br /><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/AjxwuLYvSCnf6KZMn/my-2003-post-on-the-evolutionary-argument-for-ai#comments">Discuss</a>

### [Fragments: January  8](https://martinfowler.com/fragments/2026-01-08.html)

**来源**: Martin Fowler

**摘要**: <p>Anthropic report on <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/how-ai-is-transforming-work-at-anthropic">how their AI is changing their own software development practice</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Most usage is for debugging and helping understand existing code</li>
  <li>Notable increase in using it for implementing new features</li>
  <li>Developers using it for 59% of their work and getting 50% productivity increase</li>
  <li>14% of developers are “power users” reporting much greater gains</li>
  <li>Claude helps developers to work outside their core area</li>
  <li>Concerns about changes to the profession, career evolution, and social dynamics</li>
</ul>

<p> ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p>Much of the discussion about using LLMs for software development lacks details on workflow. Rather than just hear people gush about how wonderful it is, I want to understand the gritty details. What kinds of interactions occur with the LLM? What decisions do the humans make? When reviewing LLM outputs, what kinds of things are the humans looking for, what corrections do they make?</p>

<p><a href="https://obie.medium.com/what-used-to-take-months-now-takes-days-cc8883cc21e9">Obie Fernandez</a> has written a post that goes into these kinds of details. Over the Christmas / New Year period he used Claude to build a knowledge distillation application, that takes transcripts from Claude Code sessions, slack discussion, github PR threads etc, turns them into an RDF graph database, and provides a web app with natural language ways to query them.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Not a proof of concept. Not a demo. The first cut of Nexus, a production-ready system with authentication, semantic search, an MCP server for agent access, webhook integrations for our primary SaaS platforms, comprehensive test coverage, deployed, integrated and ready for full-scale adoption at my company this coming Monday. Nearly 13,000 lines of code.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The article is long, but worth the time to read it.</p>

<p>An important feature of his workflow is relying on <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestDrivenDevelopment.html">Test-Driven Development</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here’s what made this sustainable rather than chaotic: TDD. Test-driven development. For most of the features, I insisted that Claude Code follow the red-green-refactor cycle with me. Write a failing test first. Make it pass with the simplest implementation. Then refactor while keeping tests green.</p>

  <p>This wasn’t just methodology purism. TDD served a critical function in AI-assisted development: it kept me in the loop. When you’re directing thousands of lines of code generation, you need a forcing function that makes you actually understand what’s being built. Tests are that forcing function. You can’t write a meaningful test for something you don’t understand. And you can’t verify that a test correctly captures intent without understanding the intent yourself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The account includes a major refactoring, and much evolution of the initial version of the tool. It’s also an interesting glimpse of how AI tooling may finally make RDF useful.</p>

<p> ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p>When thinking about requirements for software, most discussions focus on prioritization. Some folks talk about buckets such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method">MoSCoW set</a>: Must, Should, Could, and Want. (The old joke being that, in MoSCoW, the cow is silent, because hardly any requirements end up in those buckets.) <a href="https://world.hey.com/jason/the-obvious-the-easy-and-the-possible-2e11a3fb">Jason Fried</a> has a different set of buckets for interface design: <strong>Obvious, Easy, and Possible</strong>. This immediately resonates with me: a good way of think about how to allocate the cognitive costs for those who use a tool.</p>

<p> ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p><a href="https://www.platformer.news/fake-uber-eats-whisleblower-hoax-debunked/">Casey Newton</a> explains how he followed up on an interesting story of dark patterns in food delivery, and found it to be a fake story, buttressed by AI image and document creation. On one hand, it clarifies the important role reporters play in exposing lies that get traction on the internet. But time taken to do this is time not spent on investigating real stories</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For most of my career up until this point, the document shared with me by the whistleblower would have seemed highly credible in large part because it would have taken so long to put together. Who would take the time to put together a detailed, 18-page technical document about market dynamics just to troll a reporter? Who would go to the trouble of creating a fake badge?</p>

  <p>Today, though, the report can be generated within minutes, and the badge within seconds. And while no good reporter would ever have published a story based on a single document and an unknown source, plenty would take the time to investigate the document’s contents and see whether human sources would back it up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The internet has always been full of slop, and we have always needed to be wary of what we read there. AI now makes it easy to manufacture convincing looking evidence, and this is never more dangerous than when it confirms strongly held beliefs and fears.</p>

<p> ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7413956151144542208/">Kent Beck</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The descriptions of Spec-Driven development that I have seen emphasize writing the whole specification before implementation. This encodes the (to me bizarre) assumption that you aren’t going to learn anything during implementation that would change the specification.
I’ve heard this story so many times told so many ways by well-meaning folks–if only we could get the specification “right”, the rest of this would be easy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Like him, that story has been the constant background siren to my career in tech. But the <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/llm-learning-loop.html">learning loop</a> of experimentation is essential to the model building that’s at the heart of any kind of worthwhile specification. As <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/llm-learning-loop.html">Unmesh puts it:</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Large Language Models give us great leverage—but they only work if we focus on learning and understanding. They make it easier to explore ideas, to set things up, to translate intent into code across many specialized languages. But the real capability—our ability to respond to change—comes not from how fast we can produce code, but from how deeply we understand the system we are shaping.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When Kent defined Extreme Programming, he made <em>feedback</em> one of its four core values. It strikes me that the key to making the full use of AI in software development is how to use it to accelerate the feedback loops.</p>

<p> ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p>As I listen to people who are serious with AI-assisted programming, the crucial thing I hear is managing context. Programming-oriented tools are geting more sophisticated for that, but there’s also efforts at providing simpler tools, that allow customization. <a href="https://lixo.org">Carlos Villela</a> recently recommended Pi, and its developer, <a href="https://mariozechner.at/posts/2025-11-30-pi-coding-agent/">Mario Zechner, has an interesting blog</a> on its development.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So what’s an old guy yelling at Claudes going to do? He’s going to write his own coding agent harness and give it a name that’s entirely un-Google-able, so there will never be any users. Which means there will also never be any issues on the GitHub issue tracker. How hard can it be?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If I ever get the time to sit and really play with these tools, then something like Pi would be something I’d like to try out. Although as an addict to The One True Editor, I’m interested in some of libraries that work with that, such as <a href="https://github.com/karthink/gptel">gptel</a>. That would enable me to use Emacs’s inherent programability to create my own command set to drive the interaction with LLMs.</p>

<p> ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p>Outside of my professional work, I’ve <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/blog/13064/martins-7th-decade">posting regularly about my boardgaming</a> on the specialist site BoardGameGeek. However its blogging environment doesn’t do a good job of providing an index to my posts, so I’ve created <a href="https://martinfowler.com/boardgames/">a list of my BGG posts </a> on my own site.

**摘要**: <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gitanjalivenkatraman/">Gitanjali Venkatraman</a> does wonderful illustrations of complex subjects (which is why I was so happy to work with her on our <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/expert-generalist.html">Expert Generalists</a> article). She has now published the latest in her series of illustrated guides: tackling the complex topic of <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/content/dam/thoughtworks/documents/blog/mainframe_modernisation_illustrated_guide_2025.pdf">Mainframe Modernization</a></p>

<p>In it she illustrates the history and value of mainframes, why modernization is so tricky, and how to tackle the problem by breaking it down into tractable pieces. I love the clarity of her explanations, and smile frequently at her way of enhancing her words with her quirky pictures.</p>

<p>Gergely Orosz on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gergely.pragmaticengineer.com/post/3m7xd33hi5c2d">social media</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unpopular opinion:</p>

  <p>Current code review tools just don’t make much sense for AI-generated code</p>

  <p>When reviewing code I really want to know:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The prompt made by the dev</li>
    <li>What corrections the other dev made to the code</li>
    <li>Clear marking of code AI-generated not changed by a human</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Some people pushed back saying they don’t (and shouldn’t care) whether it was written by a human, generated by an LLM, or copy-pasted from Stack Overflow.</p>

<p>In my view it matters <em>a lot</em> - because of the second vital purpose of code review.</p>

<p>When asked why do code reviews, most people will answer the first vital purpose - quality control. We want to ensure bad code gets blocked before it hits <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/branching-patterns.html#mainline">mainline</a>. We do this to avoid bugs and to avoid other quality issues, in particular comprehensibility and ease of change.</p>

<p>But I hear the second vital purpose less often: code review is a mechanism to communicate and educate. If I’m submitting some sub-standard code, and it gets rejected, I want to know why so that I can improve my programming. Maybe I’m unaware of some library features, or maybe there’s some project-specific standards I haven’t run into yet, or maybe my naming isn’t as clear as I thought it was. Whatever the reasons, I need to know in order to learn. And my employer needs me to learn, so I can be more effective.</p>

<p>We need to know the writer of the code we review both so we can communicate our better practice to them, but also to know how to improve things. With a human, its a conversation, and perhaps some documentation if we realize we’ve needed to explain things repeatedly. But with an LLM it’s about how to modify its context, as well as humans learning how to better drive the LLM.</p>

<p> ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p>Wondering why I’ve been making a lot of posts like this recently? <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/writing-fragments.html">I explain why</a> I’ve been reviving the link blog.</p>

<p> ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p><a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/10/html-tools/">Simon Willison</a> describes how he uses LLMs to build disposable but useful web apps</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>These are the characteristics I have found to be most productive in building tools of this nature:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>A single file: inline JavaScript and CSS in a single HTML file means the least hassle in hosting or distributing them, and crucially means you can copy and paste them out of an LLM response.</li>
    <li>Avoid React, or anything with a build step. The problem with React is that JSX requires a build step, which makes everything massively less convenient. I prompt “no react” and skip that whole rabbit hole entirely.</li>
    <li>Load dependencies from a CDN. The fewer dependencies the better, but if there’s a well known library that helps solve a problem I’m happy to load it from CDNjs or jsdelivr or similar.</li>
    <li>Keep them small. A few hundred lines means the maintainability of the code doesn’t matter too much: any good LLM can read them and understand what they’re doing, and rewriting them from scratch with help from an LLM takes just a few minutes.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>His repository includes all these tools, together with transcripts of the chats that got the LLMs to build them.</p>

<p> ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p><a href="https://obie.medium.com/what-happens-when-the-coding-becomes-the-least-interesting-part-of-the-work-ab10c213c660">Obie Fernandez</a>: while many engineers are underwhelmed by AI tools, some senior engineers are finding them really valuable. He feels that senior engineers have an oft-unspoken mindset, which in conjunction with an LLM, enables the LLM to be much more valuable.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Levels of abstraction and generalization problems get talked about a lot because they’re easy to name. But they’re far from the whole story.</p>

  <p>Other tools show up just as often in real work:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>A sense for blast radius. Knowing which changes are safe to make loudly and which should be quiet and contained.</li>
    <li>A feel for sequencing. Knowing when a technically correct change is still wrong because the system or the team isn’t ready for it yet.</li>
    <li>An instinct for reversibility. Preferring moves that keep options open, even if they look less elegant in the moment.</li>
    <li>An awareness of social cost. Recognizing when a clever solution will confuse more people than it helps.</li>
    <li>An allergy to false confidence. Spotting places where tests are green but the model is wrong.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p> ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p><a href="https://friendlybit.com/python/writing-justhtml-with-coding-agents/">Emil Stenström</a> built an HTML5 parser in python using coding agents, using Github Copilot in Agent mode with Claude Sonnet 3.7. He automatically approved most commands. It took him “a couple of months on off-hours”, including at least one restart from scratch. The parser now passes all the tests in html5lib test suite.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After writing the parser, I still don’t know HTML5 properly. The agent wrote it for me. I guided it when it came to API design and corrected bad decisions at the high level, but it did ALL of the gruntwork and wrote all of the code.</p>

  <p>I handled all git commits myself, reviewing code as it went in. I didn’t understand all the algorithmic choices, but I understood when it didn’t do the right thing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although he gives an overview of what happens, there’s not very much information on his workflow and how he interacted with the LLM. There’s certainly not enough detail here to try to replicate his approach. This is contrast to Simon Willison (above) who has detailed links to his chat transcripts - although they are much smaller tools and I haven’t looked at them properly to see how useful they are.</p>

<p>One thing that is clear, however, is the vital need for a comprehensive test suite. Much of his work is driven by having that suite as a clear guide for him and the LLM agents.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>JustHTML is about 3,000 lines of Python with 8,500+ tests passing. I couldn’t have written it this quickly without the agent.</p>

  <p>But “quickly” doesn’t mean “without thinking.” I spent a lot of time reviewing code, making design decisions, and steering the agent in the right direction. The agent did the typing; I did the thinking.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>                                  ❄                                  ❄    </p>

<p>Then Simon Willison <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/15/porting-justhtml/">ported the library to JavaScript</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Time elapsed from project idea to finished library: about 4 hours, during which I also bought and decorated a Christmas tree with family and watched the latest Knives Out movie.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of his lessons:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you can reduce a problem to a robust test suite you can set a coding agent loop loose on it with a high degree of confidence that it will eventually succeed. I called this <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/30/designing-agentic-loops/">designing the agentic loop</a> a few months ago. I think it’s the key skill to unlocking the potential of LLMs for complex tasks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Our experience at Thoughtworks backs this up. We’ve been doing a fair bit of work recently in legacy modernization (mainframe and otherwise) using AI to migrate substantial software systems. Having a robust test suite is necessary (but not sufficient) to making this work. I hope to share my colleagues’ experiences on this in the coming months.</p>

<p>But before I leave Willison’s post, I should highlight his final open questions on the legalities, ethics, and effectiveness of all this - they are well-worth contemplating.</p>

### [Writing Fragments](https://martinfowler.com/articles/writing-fragments.html)

**来源**: Martin Fowler

**摘要**: <p>If you’re a regular reader of my site, you’ll have noticed that in the
last few months I’ve been making a <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/20251204-frags.html">number</a> of “fragments” <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/2025-11-19-frags.html">posts</a>. Such a post
is a short post with a bunch of little, unconnected segments. These are
usually a reference to something I’ve found on the web, sometimes a small
thought of my own.</p>

<p>A few years ago, I wouldn’t have covered these topics with posts on my
own site. Instead I would use Twitter, either retweeting someone else’s
point, or just highlighting something I’d found. But since the Muskover,
Twitter has effectively died. I’m not saying that due to any technical
issues with the site, which has mostly just been fine, nor directly due to
any of the policy changes there. The point is that lots of people have left, so that
the audience I would have reached with Twitter is now fragmented. Some
remain on X, but I see more activity on LinkedIn. There’s also Fediverse/Mastodon
and Bluesky.</p>

<p>What this means for short posts is that I can no longer just post in one
place. When I announce new articles on martinfowler.com, I announce now on
four social media sites (X, LinkedIn, Fediverse, and Bluesky). It makes
sense to do this, but I don’t want to go through all this hassle for the
kind of micro-post that Twitter served so well.</p>

<p>So I’ve started to batch them up. When I see something interesting, I
make a note. When I have enough notes, I post a fragments post. Initially I
did this in a rather ad-hoc way, just using the same mechanisms I use for
most articles, but last week I started to put in some more deliberate
mechanisms into the site. (If you’re observant, you’ll spot that in the URLs.)</p>

<p>One benefit of all of this, at least in my book, is that it means my material is
now fully visible in RSS. I’m probably showing my age, but I’m a big fan of RSS
(or in my case, strictly Atom) feeds. I miss the feel of the heyday of the
“blogosphere” before it got steamrolled by social media, and these fragment
posts are, of course, just the same as the link blogs from that era. I still use my
RSS reader every day to keep up with writers I like. (I’m pleased that Substack
makes its content available via RSS.) It bothered me a bit that my micro-founts
of Twitter knowledge weren’t visible on RSS, but was too lazy to do something
about it. Now I don’t need to - the fragments are available in my RSS feed.</p>

**摘要**: <p><a href="https://blog.robbowley.net/2025/12/04/ai-is-still-making-code-worse-a-new-cmu-study-confirms/">Rob Bowley</a> summarizes a study from Carnegie Mellon looking on the impact of AI on a bunch of open-source software projects. Like any such study, we shouldn’t take its results as definitive, but there seems enough there to make it a handy data point. The key point is that the AI code probably reduced the quality of the code base - at least if static code analysis can be trusted to determine quality. And perhaps some worrying second-order effects</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This study shows more than 800 popular GitHub projects with code quality degrading after adopting AI tools. It’s hard not to see a form of context collapse playing out in real time. If the public code that future models learn from is becoming more complex and less maintainable, there’s a real risk that newer models will reinforce and amplify those trends, producing even worse code over time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p>Rob’s post is typical of much of the thoughtful writing on AI. We can see its short-term benefits, but worry about its long-term impact. But on a much deeper note is this lovely story from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/my-80th-birthday-i-bought-myself-new-brain-jim-highsmith-8qcrc/">Jim Highsmith</a>. Jim has turned 0x50, and has spent the last decade fighting Parkinson’s disease. To help him battle it he has two AI assisted allies.</p>

<p><strong>If you read anything on AI this week, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/my-80th-birthday-i-bought-myself-new-brain-jim-highsmith-8qcrc/">make it be this</a>.</strong> It offers a positive harbinger for our future and opens my mind to a whole different perspective of the role of AI in it</p>

<p> ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p>There’s plenty of claims that AI Vibe Coding can replace software developers, something that folks like me (perhaps with a bias) think unlikely. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gergely.pragmaticengineer.com/post/3m75kmb7bh22i">Gergely Orosz</a> shared this tidbit</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Talked with an exec at a tech company who is obsessed with AI and has been for 3 years. Not a developer but company makes software. Uses AI for everything, vibe codes ideas.</p>

  <p>Here’s the kicker:</p>

  <p>Has a team of several devs to implement his vibe coded prototypes to sg workable</p>

<p>I’d love to hear more about this (and similar stories)</p>

<p> ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p><a href="https://checkeagle.com/checklists/njr/a-month-of-chat-oriented-programming/">Nick Radcliffe</a> writes about a month of using AI</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I spent a solid month “pair programming” with Claude Code, trying to suspend disbelief and adopt a this-will-be-productive mindset. More specifically, I got Claude to write well over 99% of the code produced during the month. I found the experience infuriating, unpleasant, and stressful before even worrying about its energy impact. Ideally, I would prefer not to do it again for at least a year or two. The only problem with that is that it “worked”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He stresses that his approach is the “polar opposite” of Vibe Coding. The post is long, and rambles a bit, but is worthwhile because he talks in detail about his workflow and how he uses the tool. Such posts are important so we can learn the nitty-gritty of how our programming habits are changing.</p>

<p> ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p>Along similar lines is a post of <a href="https://brianchambers.substack.com/p/chamber-of-tech-secrets-55-issue">Brian Chambers</a> on his workflow, that he calls Issue-Driven Development (and yes, I’m also sick of the “something-driven” phraseology). As with much of the better stuff I’ve heard about AI assisted work, it’s all about carefully managing the context window, ensuring the AI is focused on the right things and not distracted by textual squirrels.</p>

### [Fragments Nov 19](https://martinfowler.com/articles/2025-11-19-frags.html)

**来源**: Martin Fowler

**摘要**: <p><img alt="radar image" src="https://martinfowler.com/articles/images/frags-2025-11/radar.png" width="300px" /></p>

<p>I’ve been on the road in Europe for the last couple of weeks, and while I was there Thoughtworks released <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar">volume 33 of our Technology Radar</a>. Again it’s dominated by the AI wave, with lots of blips capturing our explorations of how to use LLMs and similar technology. “Agents” are the big thing these days but we’re also seeing growing movements in infrastructure orchestration, coding workflows - and the inevitable antipatterns. Many thanks to my colleagues for putting this together again.</p>

<p><img alt="Gergely and I recording the podcast" src="https://martinfowler.com/articles/images/frags-2025-11/podcast.png" width="400px" /></p>

<p>My trip to Europe started in Amsterdam, for a Thoughtworks event for a few of our clients there. Since I was in that lovely city, I got in touch with Gergely Orosz, host of <a href="https://www.pragmaticengineer.com/">The Pragmatic Engineer</a>, and he arranged to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQmI4XKTa0U">record a podcast</a> with me. No surprise that AI was front-and-center of the conversation, as I said it was the biggest shift I’d seen in programming during my career, comparable only to the shift to high-level languages, which even I am not old enough to have experienced. It was a fun chat and I really enjoyed myself. Gergely later joined myself James Lewis and Giles Edwards-Alexander at the Thoughtworks event the next day.</p>

<p>                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p>My travels also took me to Nüremberg, where I attended an internal conference for Siemens on the future of software architecture. When we think of technology, it’s easy to focus on the Faangs of Silicon Valley, but Siemens have a huge workforce of software developers working on heavy engineering systems like trains and factory automation. It was good to hear them talk about federated architectures, data mesh, and their use of AI.</p>

<p><img alt="Kent's graph of options vs features" src="https://martinfowler.com/articles/images/frags-2025-11/features.webp" width="400px" /></p>

<p>I’ve often used pseudo-graphs to help explain why <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/is-quality-worth-cost.html">high quality software is cheaper</a>. This time, <a href="https://tidyfirst.substack.com/p/why-does-development-slow">Kent Beck</a> creates a unique perspective to this chart, dispensing with the temporal axis to help think in terms of optionality.</p>

<p>And in another life, Edward has finally finished the great migration of the Heavy Cardboard studio and returns to the tubes with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/e8juRvm9h0c">our first game in the new digs</a>. (No surprise that it’s Age of Steam.)</p>

<p>I find most writing on software productivity to be twaddle, but Nicole
      Forsgren and Abi Noda are notable exceptions. I had a chance to take a
      look at their new book, published today, and liked it so much I wrote a

### [Fragments Nov 3](https://martinfowler.com/articles/2025-11-03-frags.html)

**来源**: Martin Fowler

**摘要**: <p>I’m very concerned about the security dangers of LLM-enabled browsers, as it’s just too easy for them to contain the <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/22/openai-ciso-on-atlas/">Lethal Trifecta</a>. For up-to-date eyes on these issues, I follow the writings of coiner of that phrase: Simon Willison. Here <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/22/openai-ciso-on-atlas/">he examines</a> a post on how OpenAI is thinking about these issues.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My takeaways from all of this? It’s not done much to influence my overall skepticism of the entire category of browser agents, but it does at least demonstrate that OpenAI are keenly aware of the problems and are investing serious effort in finding the right mix of protections.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.robbowley.net/2025/10/26/youre-probably-listening-to-the-wrong-people-about-ai-coding/">Rob Bowley</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unsurprisingly, there are a lot of strong opinions on AI assisted coding. Some engineers swear by it. Others say it’s dangerous. And of course, as is the way with the internet, nuanced positions get flattened into simplistic camps where everyone’s either on one side or the other.</p>

  <p>A lot of the problem is that people aren’t arguing about the same thing. They’re reporting different experiences from different vantage points.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>His view is that beginners are very keen on AI-coding but they don’t see the problems they are creating. Experienced folks do see this, but it takes a further level of experience to realize that <em>when used well</em> these tools are still valuable.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Interestingly, I’ve regularly seen sceptical experienced engineers change their view once they’ve been shown how you can blend modern/XP practices with AI assisted coding.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The upshot is this, is that you have be aware of the experience level of whoever is writing about this stuff - and that experience is not just in software development generally, but also in how to make use of LLMs. One thing that rings clearly from reading Simon Willison and Birgitta Böckeler is that effective use of LLMs is a skill that takes a while to develop.</p>

<p>                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p>Charlie Brown and Garfield, like most comic strip characters, never changed over the decades. But <a href="https://blog.robbowley.net/2025/10/26/youre-probably-listening-to-the-wrong-people-about-ai-coding/">Doonesbury’s</a> cast aged, had children, and some have died (I miss Lacey). Gary Trudeau retired from writing daily strips a few years ago, but his <a href="https://x.com/RealRBHJr">reruns of older strips</a> is one of the best things in the shabby remains of Twitter.</p>

<p>A couple of weeks ago, he reran one of the most <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/doonesbury/strip/archive/2025/10/22">memorable strips</a> in its whole run. The very first frame of Doonesbury introduced the character “B.D.”, a football jock never seen without his football helmet, or when on duty, his military helmet. This panel was the first time in over thirty years that B.D. was shown without a helmet, readers were so startled that they didn’t immediately notice that the earlier explosion had removed his leg. This set off a remarkable story arc about the travails of a wounded veteran. It’s my view that future generations will find Doonesbury to be a first-class work of literature, and a thoughtful perspective on contemporary America.</p>

### [v0.11.1](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/releases/tag/v0.11.1)

**来源**: vLLM GitHub Releases

**摘要**: <h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>This release includes 1456 commits from 449 contributors (184 new contributors)!</p>
<p>Key changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>PyTorch 2.9.0 + CUDA 12.9.1</strong>: Updated the default CUDA build to <code>torch==2.9.0+cu129</code>, enabling Inductor partitioning and landing multiple fixes in graph-partition rules and compile-cache integration.</li>
<li><strong>Batch-invariant <code>torch.compile</code></strong>: Generalized batch-invariant support across attention and MoE backends, with explicit support for DeepGEMM and FlashInfer on Hopper and Blackwell GPUs.</li>
<li><strong>Robust async scheduling</strong>: Fixed several correctness and stability issues in async scheduling, especially when combined with chunked prefill, structured outputs, priority scheduling, MTP, and DeepEP / DCP. We expect <code>--async-scheduling</code> to be enabled by default in the next release.</li>
<li><strong>Stronger scheduler + KV ecosystem</strong>: Improved test coverage in CI and made scheduler behavior more robust with KV connectors, prefix caching, and multi-node deployments.</li>
<li><strong>Anthropic API Support</strong>: Added support for the <code>/v1/messages</code> endpoint, allowing users to interact with <code>vllm serve</code> using Anthropic-compatible clients.</li>
</ul>
<p>Detailed release notes will be updated in the next few days.</p>

### [Gentoo looks back on 2025](https://lwn.net/Articles/1053289/)

**来源**: LWN.net (Linux Weekly News)

**摘要**: <p>Gentoo Linux has published a <a href="https://www.gentoo.org/news/2026/01/05/new-year.html">2025
project retrospective</a> that looks at how the community has evolved,
changes to the distribution, infrastructure, and finances for the
Gentoo Foundation.</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
<p>Gentoo currently consists of 31663 ebuilds for 19174 different
packages. For amd64 (x86-64), there are 89 GBytes of binary packages
available on the mirrors. Gentoo each week builds 154 distinct <a href="https://www.gentoo.org/downloads/">installation stages</a> for
different processor architectures and system configurations, with an
overwhelming part of these fully up-to-date.</p>

<p>The number of commits to the <a href="https://gitweb.gentoo.org/repo/gentoo.git/">main ::gentoo</a>
repository has remained at an overall high level in 2025, with a
slight decrease from 123942 to 112927. The number of commits by
external contributors was 9396, now across 377 unique external
authors.</p>

### [[$] SFC v. VIZIO: who can enforce the GPL?](https://lwn.net/Articles/1052734/)

**来源**: LWN.net (Linux Weekly News)

**摘要**: <p>
The
<a href="https://sfconservancy.org/">
Software Freedom Conservancy</a> (SFC) is
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/873415/">
suing</a>
<a href="https://www.vizio.com/en/home">
VIZIO</a> over smart TVs that
include software licensed under the GPL and LGPL (including the Linux kernel,
FFmpeg, systemd, and others).
VIZIO didn't provide the source code along with the device, and on request they
only provided some of it. Unlike a typical lawsuit about enforcing the GPL, the
SFC isn't suing as a copyright holder; it's suing as
a normal owner of the TV
in question. This approach opens some important legal questions, and after years
of pre-trial maneuvering (most recently resulting in
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1051984/">a ruling related to signing keys</a> that
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1052842/">is the subject of a separate article</a>),
we might finally obtain some answers when the case goes
to trial on January&#160;12. As things stand, it seems likely that the judge in
the case will rule that that the GPL-enforcement lawsuits can be a matter of
contract law, not just copyright law, which would be a major change to how GPL
enforcement works.

### [[$] GPLv2 and installation requirements](https://lwn.net/Articles/1052842/)

**来源**: LWN.net (Linux Weekly News)

**摘要**: On December 24 2025, Linus Torvalds posted <a href="https://social.kernel.org/notice/B1aR6QFuzksLVSyBZQ">a strongly
worded message</a> celebrating a <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1051984/">ruling</a> in
the ongoing <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1052734/">GPL-compliance lawsuit</a> filed
against VIZIO by the Software Freedom Conservancy (SFC).  This case and
Torvalds's response have put a spotlight on an old debate over the extent
to which the source-code requirements of the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.en.html">GNU
General Public License (version&#160;2)</a> extend to keys and other data
needed to successfully install modified software on a device.  It is worth
looking at whether this requirement exists, the subtleties in
interpretation that cloud the issue, and the extent to which, if any, the
SFC is demanding that information.

### [All color is best-effort](https://fasterthanli.me/articles/all-color-is-best-effort)

**来源**: Amos (fasterthanlime)

**摘要**: <p>I do not come to you with answers today, but rather some observations and a lot of questions.</p>

<a class="anchor" href="https://fasterthanli.me/index.xml#the-weird-glitch" id="the-weird-glitch"><h2>The weird glitch</h2></a>
<p>Recently I was editing some video and I noticed this:</p>

<p>



<source media="(max-width: 400px)" type="image/jxl" /><source media="(max-width: 900px)" type="image/jxl" /><source type="image/jxl" /><source media="(max-width: 400px)" type="image/avif" /><source media="(max-width: 900px)" type="image/avif" /><source type="image/avif" /><source media="(max-width: 400px)" type="image/webp" /><source media="(max-width: 900px)" type="image/webp" /><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="A screenshot of the video, there are visible circles at various places in the image. Some of them are black, some of them are white. The image itself shows some blue and white text composited on some blurry background, which doesn’t really matter for this, and there’s a red line horizontal up in the image. It’s very confusing." height="1126" src="https://cdn.fasterthanli.me/content/articles/all-color-is-best-effort/dvr-circles@2x~3c031f1f42693336.jxl" title="A screenshot of the video, there are visible circles at various places in the image. Some of them are black, some of them are white. The image itself shows some blue and white text composited on some blurry background, which doesn’t really matter for this, and there’s a red line horizontal up in the image. It’s very confusing." width="1966" /></p>

<p>Not what the finger is pointing at — the dots.</p>

<p>Here are the separate layers this image is made up of: the background is a stock image
I’ve licensed from Envato Elements:</p>

<p><source media="(max-width: 400px)" type="image/jxl" /><source media="(max-width: 900px)" type="image/jxl" /><source type="image/jxl" /><source media="(max-width: 400px)" type="image/avif" /><source media="(max-width: 900px)" type="image/avif" /><source type="image/avif" /><source media="(max-width: 400px)" type="image/webp" /><source media="(max-width: 900px)" type="image/webp" /><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="A picture of a canyon, darker than you’d expect." height="1126" src="https://cdn.fasterthanli.me/content/articles/all-color-is-best-effort/canyon-background@2x~dcfb5771209ddbd5.jxl" title="A picture of a canyon, darker than you’d expect." width="1966" /></p>

<p>Because I use it as a background image, I’ve cranked down the exposition in the Color tab:</p>
