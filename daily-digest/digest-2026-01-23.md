### [Neural chameleons can('t) hide from activation oracles](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/wfGYMbr4AMcH2Rv68/neural-chameleons-can-t-hide-from-activation-oracles-1)

### [How (and why) to read Drexler on AI](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/u3FcpdmDZekXxgN7L/how-and-why-to-read-drexler-on-ai)

**来源**: LessWrong - AI

**摘要**: Published on January 21, 2026 11:25 PM GMT<br /><br /><p>I have been reading Eric Drexler’s writing on the future of AI for more than a decade at this point. I love it, but I also think it can be tricky or frustrating.</p><p>More than anyone else I know, Eric seems to tap into a deep vision for how the future of technology may work — and having once tuned into this, I find many other perspectives can feel hollow. (This reminds me of how, once I had enough of a feel for how economies work, I found a lot of science fiction felt hollow, if the world presented made too little sense in terms of what was implied for off-screen variables.)</p><p>One cornerstone of Eric’s perspective on AI, as I see it, is a deep rejection of anthropomorphism. People considering current AI systems mostly have no difficulty understanding it as technology rather than person. But when discussion moves to superintelligence … well, as Eric <a href="https://aiprospects.substack.com/p/options-for-a-hypercapable-world">puts it</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Our expectations rest on biological intuitions. Every intelligence we’ve known arose through evolution, where survival was a precondition for everything else—organisms that failed to compete and preserve themselves left no descendants. Self-preservation wasn’t optional—it was the precondition for everything else. We naturally expect intelligence bundled with intrinsic, foundational drives.</p></blockquote><p>Anyhow, I think there's a lot to get from Eric’s writing — about the shape of automation at scale, the future of AI systems, and the strategic landscape. So I keep on recommending it to people. But I also feel like people keep on not quite knowing what to do with it, or how to integrate it with the rest of their thinking. So I wanted to provide my perspective on what it is and isn’t, and thoughts on how to productively spend time reading. If I can help more people to reinvent versions of Eric’s thinking for themselves, my hope is that they can build on those ideas, and draw out the implications for what the world needs to be doing.</p><figure class="image"><img alt="" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/cffbd72babd6b1c42b28f8824e5713ce7d95a6952e35113c3c6dfa76a8ddc7d3/iqyk80ynvkl2uhy4yvze" /></figure><p>If you’ve not yet had the pleasure of reading Eric’s stuff, his recent writing is available at <a href="https://aiprospects.substack.com/">AI Prospects</a>. <a href="https://aiprospects.substack.com/p/options-for-a-hypercapable-world">His most recent article</a>&nbsp;explains how a lot of his thinking fits together, and may be good to give you a rough orientation (or see below for more of my notes) — but then I’d advise choosing some part that catches your interest, and diving into the linked material.&nbsp;</p><h2>Difficulties with Drexler’s writing</h2><p>Let’s start with the health warnings:</p><ol><li>It’s abstract.</li><li>It’s dense.</li><li>It often implicitly challenges the concepts and frames we use to think about AI.</li><li>It shies away from some questions.</li></ol><p>These properties aren’t necessarily bad. Abstraction permits density, and density means it’s high value-per-word. Ontological challenge is a lot of the payload. But they do mean that it can be hard work to read and really get value from.</p><p>Correspondingly, there are a couple of failure modes to watch for:</p><ul><li>Perhaps you’ll find your eyes glazing over — you might stop reading, or might finish skimming an article and then realise you don’t really know what it was saying.</li><li><p>Perhaps you’ll think it’s saying [claim], which is dumb because [obvious reason]<span class="footnote-reference" id="fnref24bgjiqvqx"><sup><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/feed.xml?view=community-rss&amp;karmaThreshold=30#fn24bgjiqvqx">[1]</a></sup></span>.</p></li></ul><h2>How to read Drexler</h2><p>Some mathematical texts are dense, and the right way to read them is slowly and carefully — making sure that you have taken the time to understand each sentence and each paragraph before moving on.</p><p>I do not recommend the same approach with Eric’s material. A good amount of his content can amount to challenging the ontologies of popular narratives. But ontologies have a lot of supporting structure, and if you read just a part of the challenge, it may not make sense in isolation. Better to start by reading a whole article (or more!), in order to understand the lay of the land.</p><p>Once you’ve (approximately) got the whole picture, I think it’s often worth circling back and pondering more deeply. Individual paragraphs or even sentences in many cases are quite idea-dense, and can reward close consideration. I’ve benefited from coming back to some of his articles multiple times over an extended period.</p><p>Other moves that seem to me to be promising for deepening your understanding:</p><ol><li><p>Try to understand it more concretely. Consider relevant examples<span class="footnote-reference" id="fnrefr8q5pr5llul"><sup><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/feed.xml?view=community-rss&amp;karmaThreshold=30#fnr8q5pr5llul">[2]</a></sup></span>, and see how Eric’s ideas apply in those cases, and what you make of them overall.</p></li><li>Try to reconcile apparent tensions. If you feel like Eric is presenting something with some insight, but there’s another model you have which on the face of it has some conflicting insight, see if you can figure out the right way to unify the perspectives — perhaps by limiting the scope of applicability of one of the models.</li></ol><h2>What Drexler covers</h2><p>In my view, Eric’s recent writing is mostly doing three things:</p><h3>1) Mapping the technological trajectory&nbsp;</h3><p>What will advanced AI look like in practice? Insights that I’ve got from Eric’s writing here include:</p><ul><li>When it looks like there’s a hard bottleneck, the path to big impacts might just <a href="https://aiprospects.substack.com/p/the-bypass-principle-how-ai-flows">bypass it</a></li><li>AI could make <a href="https://aiprospects.substack.com/p/breaking-software-bottlenecks">software more powerful, available, and secure</a>&nbsp;— which may be strategically important</li><li>The way that knowledge is represented in AI systems could <a href="https://aiprospects.substack.com/p/large-knowledge-models">shift away from black-box neural nets</a></li><li>Why <a href="https://aiprospects.substack.com/p/the-reality-of-recursive-improvement">recursive improvement</a>&nbsp;of AI looks much more inevitable than “recursive self-improvement”</li></ul><h3>2) Pushing back on anthropomorphism</h3><p>If you talk to Eric about AI risk, he can seem almost triggered when people discuss “the AI”, presupposing a single unitary agent. One important thread of his writing is trying to convey these intuitions — not that agentic systems are impossible, but that they need not be on the critical path to transformative impacts.</p><p>My impression is that Eric’s motivations for pushing on this topic include:</p><ul><li>A view that if we have better concepts for thinking about the design space of AI systems, we’ll be able to make more informed plans</li><li><p>A judgement that many safety-relevant properties could<span class="footnote-reference" id="fnrefwpnnuf1xj38"><sup><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/feed.xml?view=community-rss&amp;karmaThreshold=30#fnwpnnuf1xj38">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;come from system-level design choices, <a href="https://aiprospects.substack.com/p/ai-safety-without-trusting-ai">more than by relying on the alignment of the individual components</a></p></li></ul><h3>3) Advocating for strategic judo</h3><p>Rather than advocate directly for “here’s how we handle the big challenges of AI” (which admittedly seems hard!), Eric pursues an argument saying roughly that:</p><ul><li>There is a <a href="https://aiprospects.substack.com/p/paretotopian-goal-alignment">broad space of outcomes which makes everyone better off</a>&nbsp;compared to the status quo<ul><li>Arms races are a <a href="https://aiprospects.substack.com/p/dont-bet-the-future-on-winning-an">bad bet</a>&nbsp;by everyone’s lights</li></ul></li><li>This is good news! It means if the conditions were right, everyone should row in the same direction</li><li>This may not seem viable now, but it will become more so as <a href="https://aiprospects.substack.com/p/security-without-dystopia-new-options">technology advances</a>&nbsp;and people <a href="https://aiprospects.substack.com/p/toward-credible-realism">better understand the strategic situation</a></li></ul><p>So rather than push towards good outcomes, Eric wants us to shape the landscape so that the powers-that-be will inevitably push towards good outcomes for us.</p><h2>The missing topics</h2><p>There are a lot of important questions that Eric doesn’t say much about. That means that you may need to supply your own models to interface with them; and also that there might be low-hanging fruit in addressing some of these and bringing aspects of Eric’s worldview to bear.</p><p>These topics include<span class="footnote-reference" id="fnref9oyzsdf7mrq"><sup><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/feed.xml?view=community-rss&amp;karmaThreshold=30#fn9oyzsdf7mrq">[4]</a></sup></span>:</p><ul><li>Even if there are lots of powerful non-agentic AI systems, what about the circumstances where people would want agents?</li><li>What should we make of the trend towards very big models so that only a few players can compete? How much should we expect economic concentration at various points in the future?</li><li>Which of the many different kinds of impact he’s discussing should we expect to <a href="https://www.forethought.org/research/the-first-type-of-transformative-ai">happen first</a>?</li><li>How might a hypercapable world of the type he points to go badly off the rails?</li><li>What are the branches in the path, and what kinds of action might have leverage over those branches?</li><li>What kind of technical or policy work would be especially valuable?</li></ul><h2>Translation and reinvention</h2><p>I used to feel bullish on other people trying to write up Eric’s ideas for different audiences. Over time, I’ve soured on this — I think what’s needed isn’t just a matter of translating simple insights, and more for people to internalize those insights, and then share the fruits.</p><p>In practice, this blurs into reinvention. Just as mastering a mathematical proof means comprehending it to the point that you can easily rederive it (rather than just remembering the steps), I think mastering Eric’s ideas is likely to involve a degree of reinventing them for yourself and making them your own. At times, I’ve done this myself<span class="footnote-reference" id="fnrefts0o3lb9rl"><sup><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/feed.xml?view=community-rss&amp;karmaThreshold=30#fnts0o3lb9rl">[5]</a></sup></span>, and I would be excited for more people to attempt it.</p><p>In fact, this would be one of my top recommendations for people trying to add value in AI strategy work. The general playbook might look like:</p><ol><li>Take one of Eric’s posts, and read over it carefully</li><li>Think through possible implications and/or tensions — potentially starting with one of the “missing topics” listed above, or places where it most seems to be conflicting with another model you have</li><li>Write up some notes on what you think</li><li>Seek critique from people and LLMs</li><li>Iterate through steps 2–4 until you’re happy with where it’s got to</li></ol><h2>Pieces I’d be especially excited to see explored</h2><p>Here’s a short (very non-exhaustive) list of questions I have, that people might want to bear in mind if they read and think about Eric’s perspectives:</p><ul><li>What kind of concrete actions would represent steps towards (or away from) a <a href="https://aiprospects.substack.com/p/paretotopian-goal-alignment">Paretotopian world</a>?</li><li>What would the kind of “<a href="https://aiprospects.substack.com/p/ai-driven-strategic-transformation">strategic transformation</a>” that Eric discusses look like in practice? Can we outline realistic scenarios?</li><li>Given the perspectives in <a href="https://aiprospects.substack.com/p/ai-safety-without-trusting-ai">AI safety without trusting AI</a>, in what conditions should we still be worried about misalignment? What would be the implications for appropriate policies of different actors?</li><li>If Eric is right about <a href="https://aiprospects.substack.com/p/large-knowledge-models">Large Knowledge Models</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://aiprospects.substack.com/p/llms-and-beyond-all-roads-lead-to">latent space</a>, what will be the impacts on model transparency, compared to current chain-of-thought in natural language?

### [Finding Yourself in Others](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/m4cGnJDpvs9LWk2dK/finding-yourself-in-others-2)

**来源**: LessWrong - AI

**摘要**: Published on January 21, 2026 11:22 PM GMT<br /><br /><p><em>"The person is an identity that emerges through relationship.... If we isolate the 'I' from the 'thou' we lose not only its otherness but also its very being; it simply cannot be without the other."</em> -- John Zizioulas, Communion and Otherness</p>
<hr />
<p>It is the third week of Anna's freshman year of high school.</p>
<p>Today, like many days, she's filled with anxiety about her place in the world. The anxiety is a sharp, piercing feeling in her chest, like she is a sphere spinning on the point of a cone. Twenty years from now, her remembering self will look back on these feelings as part of the precious journey of discovering herself; but right now, her experiencing self mostly just feels like shit.</p>
<p>Lunch is ending soon. She's about to get up. But she notices a notebook accidentally fall from a fellow student's backpack, as the other student hurriedly walks by. Anna almost raises her voice to alert the other girl -- but the notebook has flopped open on the floor, and Anna notices her own name, ANNA H, in big block letters inside the other girl's notebook.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Curiosity gets the better of her. She picks it up, and she starts reading. Just a little won't hurt, right?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I believe there is approximately a 80% chance that Anna H, Sarah R, and Ignatius C are planning to ruin my life at high school.</p>
<p>These are my notes on the matter, which will explain (1) why they are acting together, (2) why it is to their advantage to ruin me, and (3) my vulnerable points, for which I must determine a plan of defense.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anna is astounded.</p>
<p>She cannot recall the name of the student whose notebook she is reading. But she cannot stop reading <em>now</em>, obviously.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These three are obviously going to act in a coordinated fashion.</p>
<p>I have seen them at lunch together four times already. I have determined that they share many interests: <em>The Amazing Digital Circus</em>, medieval history, and the show <em>Dark</em> are among them. Furthermore, they live within five blocks of each other, which will make it easy for them to coordinate. [...]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The material on why they will ally continues for some time.</p>
<p>It remains bizarre, but also somewhat grounded in reality rather than merely insane. Anna knew that Sarah was interested in <em>The Amazing Digital Circus</em> and <em>Dark</em> -- so apparently this other student has identified <em>some</em> things accurately, despite her paranoia. But Anna didn't know that Ignatius was also interested in these things. Maybe Ignatius actually does like them! That would be... nice.</p>
<p>Ignatius seemed -- ok? -- when Anna talked with him, but it wasn't like she actually had a crush on him or something. Of course. They've had some good conversations, though, and she wonders if what he sees in <em>Dark</em> is the same as what she sees in it. And if Ignatius lives close to Anna, maybe it would make sense to spend more time with him? That could be fun. Probably it's best to have Sarah over at the same time, just to keep things chill.</p>
<p>Anna keeps reading.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The reasons they would try to ruin my life are several. I don't believe that they are -- yet -- motivated by hatred for me, but it would be advantageous to Anna, Sarah, and Ignatius to ruin my life for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anna is one of the smarter students, and we will be competing to be valedictorian.</li>
<li>Both Anna and I like Ignatius, and he can only be with one of us.</li>
<li>Competition for popularity in school is a zero-sum game, and I am vulnerable for several reasons.</li>
<li>[...]</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>A half-dozen more reasons follow.</p>
<p>Would it... make sense... for Anna to try to hurt this other person? Would that be in her interests? The question is new to her.</p>
<p>She has barely even thought about being valedictorian. But -- well, it is <em>true</em> that only one person can be valedictorian. And that would be a nice thing to be; it would be cool to be able to tell people that... at college, probably? And some of the other reasons to "ruin" this other person also seem -- well, Anna thinks, not all of them are <em>totally</em> nuts.</p>
<p>Reading the document feels confusing, almost trance-like. Anna has never before read <em>anything</em> about herself with this much detail. She's read desultory teachers' notes; polite letters from grandparents; supposed personality types from online quizzes. But this other student is interested in her in a way no one else ever has been interested before.</p>
<p>She skips down a page, reads another section header:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am vulnerable to several forms of attack: social, academic, and even physical.</p>
<p>(1) Forms of social attack could hinge on the following vulnerabilities. (To-do: categorize these more rigorously.)</p>
<ul>
<li>My acne remains difficult to eliminate, and could be turned to mockery.</li>
<li>I have noticed I sometimes trip over my words in Mr. Abelson's class; I may have a slight crush on him, which could be used as a lever against me to great effect.</li>
<li>I have a large mole on my left shoulder, whose existence I have heretofore kept hidden.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Lists like these continue for <em>pages</em>. Anna crushes down the slight feeling of discomfort of seeing all of this stranger's thoughts, laid out before her like speared butterflies. She <em>must</em> know what is going on here.</p>
<p>There are detailed, carefully-thought-out lists of vulnerabilities that Anna could take advantage of -- if she wanted to. Section headers and sub-section headers, considering methods Anna could use, countermeasures to those methods, and counter-countermeasures Anna could use to combat them. Long hypothetical asides on ways Anna <em>might</em> humiliate this person, depending on the knowledge and advantages that Anna may or may not have, that the author did not know about but wanted to mention regardless.</p>
<p>The book contains long and carefully thought-out reasons for Anna, Sarah, and Ignatius to consider themselves allies; long and carefully thought-out reasons it would be to their advantage to injure her; and long and carefully thought-out means by which they could injure her.</p>
<p>Anna looks up from the notebook, feeling a little disoriented. And notices that the other student has returned to the cafeteria, and is scanning the floor, seeking something. Seeking the notebook. Anna quickly shoves it beneath her own books.</p>
<p>The other student keeps running her eyes over the floor carefully, but doesn't seem to have found what she was searching for. She looks up, and notices Anna looking at her. An expression crosses her face -- will she ask Anna a question?</p>
<p>They stare at each other.</p>
<p>But the moment passes, and the girl turns away.</p>
<p>For a moment Anna feels turmoil in her stomach, an uncertainty about what feelings she is actually experiencing. She swims in an internal sea, seeking the right word. But then what feels like enlightenment snaps into focus: <em>Oh God, this girl really is a coward. How contemptible.</em></p>
<p>She is going to show Sarah and Ignatius the notebook. Of course she would -- they deserve to know, they're in it, aren't they? How could she do anything else?</p>
<p>Tonight is going to be a really fantastic night.</p>

### [Claude Codes #3](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/rCf8KLrpzdtFoFTJD/claude-codes-3)

**来源**: LessWrong - AI

**摘要**: Published on January 21, 2026 7:50 PM GMT<br /><br /><p>We’re back with all the Claude that’s fit to Code. I continue to have great fun with it and find useful upgrades, but the biggest reminder is that you need the art to have an end other than itself. Don’t spend too long improving your setup, or especially improving how you improve your setup, without actually working on useful things.</p>


<h4>The Efficient Market Hypothesis</h4>


<p><a href="https://x.com/patio11/status/2014043381266006467">Odd Lots covered Claude Code</a>. Fun episode, but won’t teach my regular readers much that is new.</p>
<p>Bradly Olsen at the Wall Street Journal reports <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/anthropic-claude-code-ai-7a46460e?mod=Searchresults&amp;pos=1&amp;page=1">Claude [Code and now Cowork are] Taking the AI World By Storm, and ‘Even Non-Nerds Are Blown Away</a>.’</p>
<div>


<span id="more-25043"></span>


</div>
<p>It is remarkable how everyone got the ‘Google is crushing everyone’ narrative going with Gemini 3, then it took them a month to realize that actually Anthropic is crushing everyone, at least among the cognoscenti with growing momentum elsewhere, with Claude Code and Claude Opus 4.5. People are realizing you can know almost nothing and still use it to do essentially everything.</p>
<p>Are Claude Code and Codex having a ‘GPT moment’?</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://x.com/wallstengine/status/2011824292133232817">Wall St Engine</a>: Morgan Stanley says Anthropic’s ClaudeCode + Cowork is dominating investor chatter and adding pressure on software.</p>
<p>They flag OpenRouter token growth “going vertical,” plus anecdotes that the Cowork launch pushed usage hard enough to crash Opus 4.5 and hit rate limits, framing it as another “GPT moment” and a net positive for AI capex.</p>
<p>They add that OpenAI sentiment is still shaky: some optimism around a new funding round and Blackwell-trained models in 2Q, but competitive worries are widening beyond $GOOGL to Anthropic, with Elon Musk saying the OpenAI for-profit conversion lawsuit heads to trial on April 27.</p></blockquote>


<h4>Huh, Upgrades</h4>


<p><a href="https://x.com/claudeai/status/2012215329070493971">Claude Cowork is now available to Pro subscribers</a>, not only Max subscribers.</p>
<p>Claude Cowork will ask explicit permission before all deletions, add new folders in the directory picker without starting over and make smarter connector suggestions.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/adocomplete/status/2011927756599353763">Claude Code on the web gets a good looking diff view</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/bcherny/status/2013855643149512726">Claude Code for VSCode has now officially shipped</a>, it’s been available for a while. To drag and drop files, hold shift.</p>
<p><a href="https://luma.com/claudecommunity">Claude Code now has ‘community events</a>’ in various cities. New York and San Francisco aren’t on the list, but also don’t need to be.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/ClaudeCodeLog/status/2011988899321589800">Claude Code upgraded to 2.1.9</a>, and <a href="https://x.com/ClaudeCodeLog/status/2012340283283849487">then to 2.1.10 and 2.1.11</a> which were tiny, and <a href="https://x.com/ClaudeCodeLog/status/2013779041656938862">now has reached 2.1.14</a>.</p>
<p>Few have properly updated for this sentence: ‘Claude Codex was built in 1.5 weeks with Claude Code.’</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://x.com/nabeelqu/status/2011453803498008723">Nabeel S. Qureshi</a>: I don’t even see how you can be an AI ‘skeptic’ anymore when the *current* AI, right in front of us, is so good, e.g. see Claude Cowork being written by Claude Code in 1.5 weeks.</p>
<p>It’s over, the skeptics were wrong.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://x.com/adocomplete/status/2013296833871696360">Planning mode now automatically clears context when you accept a plan</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.testingcatalog.com/anthropic-works-on-customizable-commands-for-claude-code/">Anthropic is developing a new Customize section for Claude</a> to centralize Skills, connectors and upcoming commands for Claude Code. My understanding is that custom commands already exist if you want to create them, but reducing levels of friction, including levels of friction in reducing levels of friction, is often highly valuable. A way to browse skills and interact with the files easily, or see and manage your connectors, or an easy interface for defining new commands, seems great.</p>


<h4>Obsidian</h4>


<p>I highly recommend using Obsidian or another similar tool together with Claude Code. This gives you a visual representation of all the markdown files, and lets you easily navigate and search and edit them, and add more and so on. I think it’s well worth keeping it all human readable, where that human is you.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/arscontexta/status/2013655662752862360">Heinrich calls it ‘vibe note taking</a>’ whether or not you use Obsidian. I think the notes are a place you want to be less vibing and more intentional, and be systematically optimizing the notes, for both Claude Code and for your own use.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/EleanorKonik/status/2013606992040837465">You can combine Obsidian and Claude Code directly via the Obsidian terminal plugin</a>, but I don’t see any mechanical advantage to doing so.</p>


<h4>New Tools</h4>


<p><a href="https://x.com/blader/status/2013031655934697498">Siqi Chen</a> offers us <a href="https://t.co/S48m5wqQGE">/claude-continuous-learning</a>. Claude’s evaluation is that this could be good if you’re working in codebases where you need to continuously learn things, but the overhead and risk of clutter are real.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/jasminewsun/status/2012252234831266179">Jasmine Sun created a tool</a> to <a href="https://t.co/RBOQJloZEg">turn any YouTube podcast into a clean, grammatical PDF transcript with chapters and takeaways</a>.</p>


<h4>Tool Search</h4>


<p>The big change with Claude Code version 2.1.7 was <a href="https://x.com/ClaudeCodeLog/status/2011230548572651853">enabled MCP tool search auto mode by default</a>, which triggers when MCP tools are more than 10% of the context window. You can disable this by adding ‘MCPSearch’ to ‘disallowedTools’ in settings. This seems big for people using a lot of MCPs at once, which could eat a lot of context.</p>
<blockquote><p>Thariq (Anthropic): ​Today we’re rolling out MCP Tool Search for Claude Code.</p>
<p>As MCP has grown to become a more popular protocol and agents have become more capable, we’ve found that MCP servers may have up to 50+ tools and take up a large amount of context.</p>
<p>Tool Search allows Claude Code to dynamically load tools into context when MCP tools would otherwise take up a lot of context.</p>
<p><strong>How it works:<br />
</strong>– Claude Code detects when your MCP tool descriptions would use more than 10% of context<br />
– When triggered, tools are loaded via search instead of preloaded</p>
<p>Otherwise, MCP tools work exactly as before. This resolves one of our most-requested features on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/7336">lazy loading for MCP servers</a>. Users were documenting setups with 7+ servers consuming 67k+ tokens.</p>
<p><strong>If you’re making a MCP server<br />
</strong>Things are mostly the same, but the “server instructions” field becomes more useful with tool search enabled. It helps Claude know when to search for your tools, similar to skills</p>
<p><strong>If you’re making a MCP client<br />
</strong>We highly suggest implementing the ToolSearchTool, <a href="https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/tool-search-tool">you can find the docs here</a>. We implemented it with a custom search function to make it work for Claude Code.</p>
<p><strong>What about programmatic tool calling?<br />
</strong>We experimented with doing programmatic tool calling such that MCP tools could be composed with each other via code. While we will continue to explore this in the future, we felt the most important need was to get Tool Search out to reduce context usage.</p>
<p>Tell us what you think here or on Github as you see the ToolSearchTool work.</p></blockquote>
<p>With that solved, presumably you should be ‘thinking MCP’ at all times, it is now safe to load up tons of them even if you rarely use each one individually.</p>


<h4>Out Of The Box</h4>


<p>Well, yes, this is happening.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://x.com/bayeslord/status/2011467932618879339">bayes</a>: everyone 3 years ago: omg what if ai becomes too widespread and then it turns against us with the strategic advantage of our utter and total dependence</p>
<p>everyone now: hi claude here’s my social security number and root access to my brain i love you please make me rich and happy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Some of us three years ago were pointing out, loud and clear, that exactly this was obviously going to happen, modulo various details. Now you can see it clearly.</p>
<p>Not giving Claude a lot of access is going to slow things down a lot. The only thing holding most people back was the worry things would accidentally get totally screwed up, and that risk is a lot lower now. Yes, obviously this all causes other concerns, including prompt injections, but in practice on an individual level the risk-reward calculation is rather clear. It’s not like Google didn’t effectively have root access to our digital lives already. And it’s not like a truly rogue AI couldn’t have done all these things without having to ask for the permissions.</p>
<p>The humans are going to be utterly dependent on the AIs in short order, and the AIs are going to have access, collectively, to essentially everything. Grok has root access to Pentagon classified information, so if you’re wondering where we draw the line the answer is there is no line. Let the right one in, and hope there is a right one?</p>


<h4>Skilling Up</h4>


<p><a href="https://x.com/ghumare64/status/2012136491133145364">What’s better than one agent? Multiple agents</a> that work together and that don’t blow up your budget. Rohit Ghumare offers a guide to this.</p>
<blockquote><p>Rohit Ghumare: Single agents hit limits fast. Context windows fill up, decision-making gets muddy, and debugging becomes impossible. Multi-agent systems solve this by distributing work across specialized agents, similar to how you’d structure a team.</p>
<p>The benefits are real:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Specialization</strong>: Each agent masters one domain instead of being mediocre at everything</li>
<li><strong>Parallel processing</strong>: Multiple agents can work simultaneously on independent subtasks</li>
<li><strong>Maintainability</strong>: When something breaks, you know exactly which agent to fix</li>
<li><strong>Scalability</strong>: Add new capabilities by adding new agents, not rewriting everything</li>
</ul>
<p>The tradeoff: coordination overhead. Agents need to communicate, share state, and avoid stepping on each other. Get this wrong and you’ve just built a more expensive failure mode.​</p></blockquote>
<p>You can do this with a supervisor agent, which scales to about 3-8 agents, if you need quality control and serial tasks and can take a speed hit. To scale beyond that you’ll need hierarchy, the same as you would with humans, which gets expensive in overhead, the same as it does in humans.</p>
<p>Or you can use a peer-to-peer swarm that communicates directly if there aren’t serial steps and the tasks need to cross-react and you can be a bit messy.</p>
<p>You can use a shared state and set of objects, or you can pass messages. You also need to choose a type of memory.</p>
<p>My inclination is by default you should use supervisors and then hierarchy. Speed takes a hit but it’s not so bad and you can scale up with more agents. Yes, that gets expensive, but in general the cost of the tokens is less important than the cost of human time or the quality of results, and you can be pretty inefficient with the tokens if it gets you better results.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/omooretweets/status/2014010732061638949">Olivia Moore offers a basic guide to Cursor and Claude Code for nontechnical folks.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/SuhailKakar/status/2012858927084699799">Here’s another Twitter post with basic tips</a>. I need to do better on controlling context and starting fresh windows for each issue, in particular.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://x.com/mitchellh/status/2013679011315196144">Mitchell Hashimoto</a>: It’s pretty cool that I can tell an agent that CI broke at some point this morning, ask it to use `git bisect` to find the offending commit, and fix it. I then went to the bathroom, talked to some people in the hallway, came back, and it did a swell job.</p></blockquote>
<p>Often you’ll want to tell the AI what tool is best for the job. Patrick McKenzie points out that even if you don’t know how the orthodox solution works, as long as you know the name of the orthodox solution, <a href="https://x.com/patio11/status/2013691269193625604">you can say ‘use [X]’ and that’s usually good enough</a>. One place I’ve felt I’ve added a lot of value is when I explain why I believe that a solution to a problem exists, or that a method of some type should work, and then often Claude takes it from there. My taste is miles ahead of my ability to implement.</p>


<h4>The Art Must Have An End Other Than Itself Or It Collapses Into Infinite Recursion</h4>


<p>Always be trying to get actual use out of your setup as you’re improving it. It’s so tempting to think ‘oh obviously if I do more optimization first that’s more efficient’ but this prevents you knowing what you actually need, and it risks getting caught in an infinite loop.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://x.com/deepfates/status/2012984897388859403">@deepfates</a>: Btw thing you get with claude code is not psychosis either. It’s mania</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/nearcyan/status/2012687063355625583">near</a>: men will go on a claude code weekend bender and have nothing to show for it but a “more optimized claude setup”</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/DanielleFong/status/2012704500302360979">Danielle Fong </a>: that’s ok i’ll still keep drinkin’ that garbage</p>
<p>palcu: spent an hour tweaking my settings.local.json file today</p>
<p>Near: i got hit hard enough to wonder about finetuning a model to help me prompt claude since i cant cross-prompt claudes the way i want to (well, i can sometimes, but not all the time). many causalities, <a href="https://x.com/nearcyan/status/2012691772686598197">stay safe out there</a> <img alt="🙏" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/2azxasXxuhXvGfdW2/io7vrzptxl7fimogsqhe" style="height: 1em;" /></p>

<div></div>
</div>

</div>
<p><a href="https://x.com/nearcyan/status/2013844632216473796">near</a>: claude code is a cursed relic causing many to go mad with the perception of power. they forget what they set out to do, they forget who they are. now enthralled with the subtle hum of a hundred instances, they no longer care. hypomania sets in as the outside world becomes a blur.</p></blockquote>
<p>Always optimize in the service of a clear target. Build the pieces you need, as you need them. Otherwise, beware.</p>


<h4>Safely Skip Permissions</h4>


<blockquote><p><a href="https://x.com/nickcammarata/status/2012607696533340420">Nick</a>: need –dangerously-skip-permissions-except-rm</p>

<p>Yes, you could use a virtual machine, but that introduces some frictions that many of us want to avoid.</p>
<p>​I’m experimenting with using a similar hook system plus a bunch of broad permissions, rather than outright using –dangerously-skip-permissions, but definitely thinking to work towards dangerously skipping permissions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


<h4>A Matter of Trust</h4>


<p>At first everyone laughed at Anthropic’s obsession with safety and trust, and its stupid refusals. Now that Anthropic has figured out how to make dangerous interactions safer, it can actually do the opposite. In contexts where it is safe and appropriate to take action, Claude knows that refusal is not a ‘safe’ choice, and is happy to help.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://x.com/deanwball/status/2011398376093278577">Dean W. Ball</a>: One underrated fact is that OpenAI’s Codex and Gemini CLI have meaningfully heavier guardrails than Claude Code. These systems have refused many tasks (for example, anything involving research into and execution of investing strategies) that Claude Code happily accepts. Codex/Gemini also seek permission more.</p>
<p>The conventional narrative is that “Anthropic is more safety-pilled than the others.” And it’s definitely true that Claude is likelier to refuse tasks relating to eg biology research. But overall the current state of play would seem to be that Anthropic is more inclined to let their agents rip than either OAI or GDM.</p>
<p>My guess is that this comes down to Anthropic creating guardrails principally via a moral/ethical framework, and OAI/GDM doing so principally via lists of rules. But just a guess.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/tyler_m_john/status/2011400602769879223">Tyler John</a>: The proposed explanation is key. If true, it means that Anthropic’s big investment in alignment research is paying off by making the model much more usable.</p></blockquote>
<p>Investment strategizing tends to be safe across the board, but there are presumably different lines on where they become unwilling to help you execute. So far, I have not had Claude Code refuse a request from me, not even once.</p>


<h4>Code Versus Cowork</h4>


<blockquote><p><a href="https://x.com/deanwball/status/2011954423778467874">Dean W. Ball</a>: My high-level review of Claude Cowork:</p>
<ol>
<li>It’s probably superior for many users to Claude Code just because of the UI.</li>
<li>It’s not obviously superior for me, not so much because the command line is such a better UI, but because Opus in Claude Code seems more capable to me than in Cowork. I’m not sure if this is because Code is better as a harness, because the model has more permissive guardrails in Code, or both.</li>
<li>There are certain UI niceties in Cowork I like very much; for example, the ability to leave a comment or clarification on any item in the model’s active to-do list while it is running–this is the kind of thing that is simply not possible to do nicely within the confines of a Terminal UI.</li>
<li>Cowork probably has a higher ceiling as a product, simply because a GUI allows for more experimentation. I am especially excited to see GUI innovation in the orchestration and oversight of multi-agent configurations. We have barely scratched the surface here.</li>
<li>Because of (4), if I had to bet money, I’d bet that within 6-12 months Cowork and similar products will be my default tool for working with agents, beating out the command-line interfaces. But for now, the command-line-based agents remain my default.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>I haven’t tried Cowork myself due to the Mac-only restriction and because I don’t have a problem working with the command line. I’ve essentially transitioned into Claude Code for everything that isn’t pure chat, since it seems to be more intelligent and powerful in that mode than it does on the web even if you don’t need the extra functionality.</p>


<h4>Claude Cowork Offers Mundane Utility</h4>


<p>The joy of the simple things:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://x.com/MattBruenig/status/2011895261044621715">Matt Bruenig</a>: lot of lower level Claude Code use is basically just the recognition that you can kind of do everything with bash and python one-liners, it’s just no human has the time or will to write them.</p></blockquote>
<p>Or to figure out how to write them.</p>
<p>Enjoying the almost as simple things:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://x.com/adocomplete/status/2011194268518662646">Ado</a>: Here’s a fun use case for Claude Cowork.</p>
<p>I was thinking of getting a hydroponic garden. I asked Claude to go through my grocery order history on various platforms and sum up vegetable purchases to justify the ROI.</p>
<p>Worked like a charm!</p>
<p>For some additional context:</p>
<p>– it looked at 2 orders on each platform (Kroger, Safeway, Instacart)<br />
– It extrapolated to get the annual costs from there</p>
<p>Could have gotten more accurate by downloading order history in a CSV and feeding that to Claude, but this was good enough.</p></blockquote>
<p>The actual answer is that very obviously it was not worth it for Ado to get a hydroponic garden, because his hourly rate is insanely high, but this is a fun project and thus goes by different standards.</p>
<p>The transition from Claude Code to Claude Cowork, for advanced users, if you’ve got a folder with the tools then the handoff should be seamless:</p>
<blockquote><p>​<a href="https://x.com/ttunguz/status/2011189040591319304">Tomasz Tunguz</a>: I asked Claude Cowork to read my tools folder. Eleven steps later, it understood how I work.</p>
<p>Over the past year, I built a personal operating system inside Claude Code : scripts to send email, update our CRM, research startups, draft replies. Dozens of small tools wired together. All of it lived in a folder on my laptop, accessible only through the terminal.</p>
<p>Cowork read that folder, parsed each script, &amp; added them to its memory. Now I can do everything I did yesterday, but in a different interface. The capabilities transferred. The container didn’t matter.</p>
<p>My tools don’t belong to the application anymore. They’re portable. In the enterprise, this means laptops given to new employees would have Cowork installed plus a collection of tools specific to each role : the accounting suite, the customer support suite, the executive suite.</p>
<p>The name choice must have been deliberate. Microsoft trained us on copilot for three years : an assistant in the passenger seat, helpful but subordinate. Anthropic chose cowork. You’re working with someone who remembers how you like things done.</p>
<p>We’re entering an era where you just tell the computer what to do. Here’s all my stuff. Here are the five things we need to do today. When we need to see something, a chart, a document, a prototype, an interface will appear on demand.</p>
<p>The current version of Cowork is rough. It’s slow. It crashed twice on startup. It changed the authorization settings for my Claude Code installation. <a href="https://tomtunguz.com/thoughts-on-claude-coworker/">But the promised power is enough to plow through</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/simonw/status/2011570719856214153">Simon Willison</a>: This is great – context pollution is why I rarely used MCP, now that it’s solved there’s no reason not to hook up dozens or even hundreds of MCPs to Claude Code.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://x.com/venturetwins/status/2011474999094513881">Justine Moore has Claude Cowork write up threads</a> on NeurIPS best papers, generate graphics for them on Krea and validate this with ChatGPT. Not the best thing.</p>


<h4>Claude Code Offers Mundane Utility</h4>


<p><a href="https://x.com/peterwildeford/status/2012345003217965109">Peter Wildeford is having success doing one-shot Instacart orders from plans</a> without an explicit list, and also one-shotting an Uber Eats order.</p>
<p>A SaaS vendor (Cypress) a startup was using tried to double their price from $70k to $170k a year,<a href="https://x.com/codyschneiderxx/status/2011105976921813032"> so the startup does a three week sprint and duplicates the product.</a> Or at least, that’s the story.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/RobertHaisfield/status/2011110498461422049">By default Claude Code only saves 30 days of session history</a>. I can’t think of a good reason not to change this so it saves sessions indefinitely, you never know when that will prove useful. So tell Claude Code to change that for you by setting cleanupPeriodDays to 0.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://x.com/xuenay/status/2013292333710631438">Kaj Sotala</a>: People were talking about how you can also use Claude Code as a general-purpose assistant for any files on your computer, so I had Claude Code do some stuff like extracting data from a .csv file and rewriting it and putting it into another .csv file</p>
<p>Then it worked great and then I was like “it’s dumb to use an LLM for this, Claude could you give me a Python script that would do the same” and then it did and then that script worked great</p>
<p>So uhh I can recommend using Claude Code as a personal assistant for your local files I guess, trying to use it that way got me an excellent non-CC solution</p></blockquote>
<p>Yep. Often the way you ues Claude Code is to notice that you can automate things and then have it automate the automation process. It doesn’t have to do everything itself any more than you do.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/petergyang/status/2011098470757851528">An explanation</a> (<a href="https://t.co/Ggqaa3F11Z">direct link to 15 minute video</a>) of what Claude skills are.</p>


<h4>Vibe Coding Requires Good Vibes</h4>


<p><a href="https://x.com/JI/status/2011207791764283690">James Ide points out that ‘vibe coding</a>’ anything serious still requires a deep understanding of software engineering and computer systems. You need to figure out and specify what you want. You need to be able to spot the times it’s giving you something different than you asked for, or is otherwise subtly wrong. Typing source code is dead, but reading source code and the actual art of software engineering are very much not.</p>
<p>I find the same, and am rapidly getting a lot better at various things as I go.</p>


<h4>Codex of Ultimate Vibing</h4>


<p>Every’s Dan Shipper writes that <a href="https://every.to/chain-of-thought/openai-has-some-catching-up-to-do">OpenAI has some catching up to do</a>, as his office has with one exception turned entirely to Claude Code with Opus 4.5, where a year ago it would have been all GPT models, and a month prior there would have been a bunch of Codex CLI and GPT 5.1 in Cursor alongside Claude Code.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/LLMJunky/status/2011937820772876430">Codex did add the ability</a> to instruct mid-execution with new prompts without the need to interrupt the agent (requires /experimental), but Claude Code already did that.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/HCSolakoglu/status/2013840420661260574">There are those who still prefer Codex and GPT-5.2, such as Hasan Can</a>. They are very much in the minority lately, but if you’re a heavy duty coder definitely check and see which option works best for you, and consider potential hybrid strategies.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/tyler_m_john/status/2011941906956140780">One hybrid strategy is that Claude Code can directly call the Gemini CLI,</a> even without an API key. Tyler John reports it is a great workflow, as Gemini can spot things Claude missed and act as a reviewer and way to call out Claude on its mistakes. <a href="https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli">Gemini CLI is here.</a></p>


<h4>No Soup For You</h4>


<p>Contrary to claims by some, including George Hotz, <a href="https://x.com/seconds_0/status/2011569723390194074">Anthropic did not cut off OpenRouter or other similar services from Claude Opus 4.5</a>. The API exists. They can use it.</p>
<p>What other interfaces cannot do is use the Claude Code authorization token to use the tokens from your Claude subscription for a different service, which was always against Anthropic’s ToS. The subscription is a special deal.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://x.com/marcosnils/status/2011600088557121877">​Marcos Nils</a>: We exchanged postures through DMs but I’m on the other side regarding this matter. Devs knew very well what they were doing while breaking CC’s ToS by spoofing and reverse engineering CC to use the max subscription in unintended ways.</p>
<p>I think it’s important to separate the waters here:</p>
<p>– Could Anthropic’s enforcement have been handled better? sureley, yes<br />
– Were devs/users “deceived” or got a different service for what they paid for? I don’t think so.</p>
<p>Not only this, it’s even worse than that. OpenCode intentionally knew they were violating Claude ToS by allowing their users to use the max subscription in the first place.</p>
<p>I guess people just like to complain.</p></blockquote>
<p>I agree that Anthropic’s communications about this could have been better, but what they actually did was tolerate a rather blatant loophole for a while, allowing people to use Claude on the cheap and probably at a loss for Anthropic, which they have now reversed with demand surging faster than they can spin up servers.</p>


<h4>Server Overload</h4>


<p><a href="https://x.com/OpenRouterAI/status/2011229861965414667">Claude Codes quite a lot, usage is taking off. Here’s OpenRouter</a> (this particular use case might be confounded a bit by the above story where they cut off alternative uses of Claude Code authorization tokens, but I’m guessing mostly it isn’t):</p>

<h4>Here’s The Pitch</h4>


<blockquote><p><a href="https://x.com/aidanshandle/status/2013065085212606831">aidan</a>: If I were running Claude marketing the tagline would be “Why not today?”</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/omooretweets/status/2013061472407208311">Olivia Moore</a>: Suddenly seeing lots of paid creator partnerships with Claude</p>
<p>Many of them are beautifully shot and focused on: (1) building personal software; or (2) deep learning</p>
<p>The common tagline is “Think more, not less”</p></blockquote>
<p>She shared a sample TikTok, showing a woman who doesn’t understand math using Claude to automatically code up visualizations to help her understand science, which seemed great.</p>
<p>OpenAI takes the approach of making things easy on the user and focusing on basic things like cooking or workouts. Anthropic shows you a world where anything is possible and you can learn and engage your imagination. Which way, modern man?</p>


<h4>The Lighter Side</h4>


<p><a href="https://x.com/peterwildeford/status/2012646864332664924">And yet some people think the AIs won’t be able to take over</a>.</p>

## Engineering

### [Fragments: January 22](https://martinfowler.com/fragments/2026-01-22.html)

**来源**: Martin Fowler

**摘要**: <p>My colleagues here at Thoughtworks have announced <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/ai/works">AI/works™</a>, a platform for our work using AI-enabled software development. The platform is in its early days, and is currently intended to support Thoughtworks consultants in their client work. I’m looking forward to sharing what we learn from using and further developing the platform in future months.</p>

<p> ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p>Simon Couch <a href="https://www.simonpcouch.com/blog/2026-01-20-cc-impact/">examines the electricity consumption</a> of using AI. He’s a heavy user: “usually programming for a few hours, and driving 2 or 3 Claude Code instances at a time”. He finds his usage of electricity is orders of magnitude more than typical estimates based on the “typical query”.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On a median day, I estimate I consume 1,300 Wh through Claude Code—4,400 “typical queries” worth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But it’s still not a massive amount of power - similar to that of running a dishwasher.</p>

<p>A caveat to this is that this is “napkin math” because we don’t have decent data about how these model use resources. I agree with him that we ought to.</p>

<p> ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p>My namesake Chad Fowler (no relation) considers that the movement to agentic coding creates a similar <a href="https://aicoding.leaflet.pub/3mbrvhyye4k2e">shift in rigor and discipline</a> as appeared in Extreme Programming, dynamic languages, and continuous deployment.</p>

<p>In Extreme Programming’s case, this meant a lot of discipline around testing, continuous integration, and keeping the code-base healthy. My current view is that with AI-enabled development we need to be rigorous about evaluating the software, both for its observable behavior and its internal quality.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The engineers who thrive in this environment will be the ones who relocate discipline rather than abandon it. They’ll treat generation as a capability that demands more precision in specification, not less. They’ll build evaluation systems that are harder to fool than the ones they replaced. They’ll refuse the temptation to mistake velocity for progress.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p>There’s been much written about the dreadful events in Minnesota, and I’ve not felt I’ve had anything useful to add to them. But I do want to pass on an excellent post from <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/why-are-federal-agents-gunning-down">Noah Smith</a> that captures many of my thoughts. He points out that there is a “consistent record of brutality, aggression, dubious legality, and unprofessionalism” from ICE (and CBP) who seem to be turning into MAGA’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturmabteilung">SD</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is this America now? A country where unaccountable and poorly trained government agents go door to door, arresting and beating people on pure suspicion, and shooting people who don’t obey their every order or who try to get away? “When a federal officer gives you instructions, you abide by them and then you get to keep your life” is a perfect description of an authoritarian police state. None of this is Constitutional, every bit of it is deeply antithetical to the American values we grew up taking for granted.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My worries about these kinds of developments were what animated me to urge against voting for Trump in the <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/vote-against-trump.html">2016 election</a>. Mostly those worries didn’t come to fruition because enough constitutional Republicans were in a position to stop them from happening, so even when Trump attempted a coup in 2020, he wasn’t able to get very far. But now those constitutional Republicans are absent or quiescent. I fear that what we’ve seen in Minneapolis will be a harbinger of worse to come.</p>

<p>I also second John Gruber’s <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2026/01/lets_call_a_murder_a_murder">praise of bystander Caitlin Callenson</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But then, after the murderous agent fired three shots — just 30 or 40 feet in front of Callenson — Callenson had the courage and conviction to stay with the scene and keep filming. Not to run away, but instead to follow the scene. To keep filming. To continue documenting with as best clarity as she could, what was unfolding.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The recent activity in  Venezuala reminds me that I’ve long felt that Trump is a Hugo Chávez figure - a charismatic populist who’s keen on wrecking institutions and norms. Trump is old, so won’t be with us for that much longer - but the question is: “who is Trump’s Maduro?”</p>

<p> ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p>With all the drama at home, we shouldn’t ignore the terrible things that happened in Iran. The people there again suffered again the consequences of an entrenched authoritarian police state.</p>

### [Conversation: LLMs and the what/how loop](https://martinfowler.com/articles/convo-what-how.html)

**来源**: Martin Fowler

**摘要**: <p>A conversation between <b class="author">Unmesh Joshi</b>, <b class="author">Rebecca
      Parsons</b>, and <b class="author">Martin Fowler</b> on how LLMs help us
      shape the abstractions in our software. We view our challenge as building
      systems that survive change, requiring us to manage our cognitive load. We
      can do this by mapping the &#x201c;what&#x201d; of we want our software to do into the
      &#x201c;how&#x201d; of programming languages. This &#x201c;what&#x201d; and &#x201c;how&#x201d; are built up in a
      feedback loop. TDD helps us operationalize that loop, and LLMs allow us to
      explore that loop in an informal and more fluid manner.</p>

<p><b class="author">Jim Highsmith</b> notes that many teams have turned into
      tribes wedded to exclusively adaptation or optimization. But he feels this
      misses the point that both of these are important, and we need to manage
      the tension between them. We can do this by thinking of two operating
      modes: explore (adaptation-dominant) and exploit (optimization dominant).
      We tailor a team's operating model to a particular blend of the two -
      considering uncertainty, risk, cost of change, and an evidence threshold.
      We should be particularly careful at the points where there is a handoff
      between the two modes</p>

### [Fragments: January  8](https://martinfowler.com/fragments/2026-01-08.html)

**来源**: Martin Fowler

**摘要**: <p>Anthropic report on <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/how-ai-is-transforming-work-at-anthropic">how their AI is changing their own software development practice</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Most usage is for debugging and helping understand existing code</li>
  <li>Notable increase in using it for implementing new features</li>
  <li>Developers using it for 59% of their work and getting 50% productivity increase</li>
  <li>14% of developers are “power users” reporting much greater gains</li>
  <li>Claude helps developers to work outside their core area</li>
  <li>Concerns about changes to the profession, career evolution, and social dynamics</li>
</ul>

<p> ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p>Much of the discussion about using LLMs for software development lacks details on workflow. Rather than just hear people gush about how wonderful it is, I want to understand the gritty details. What kinds of interactions occur with the LLM? What decisions do the humans make? When reviewing LLM outputs, what kinds of things are the humans looking for, what corrections do they make?</p>

<p><a href="https://obie.medium.com/what-used-to-take-months-now-takes-days-cc8883cc21e9">Obie Fernandez</a> has written a post that goes into these kinds of details. Over the Christmas / New Year period he used Claude to build a knowledge distillation application, that takes transcripts from Claude Code sessions, slack discussion, github PR threads etc, turns them into an RDF graph database, and provides a web app with natural language ways to query them.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Not a proof of concept. Not a demo. The first cut of Nexus, a production-ready system with authentication, semantic search, an MCP server for agent access, webhook integrations for our primary SaaS platforms, comprehensive test coverage, deployed, integrated and ready for full-scale adoption at my company this coming Monday. Nearly 13,000 lines of code.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The article is long, but worth the time to read it.</p>

<p>An important feature of his workflow is relying on <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestDrivenDevelopment.html">Test-Driven Development</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here’s what made this sustainable rather than chaotic: TDD. Test-driven development. For most of the features, I insisted that Claude Code follow the red-green-refactor cycle with me. Write a failing test first. Make it pass with the simplest implementation. Then refactor while keeping tests green.</p>

  <p>This wasn’t just methodology purism. TDD served a critical function in AI-assisted development: it kept me in the loop. When you’re directing thousands of lines of code generation, you need a forcing function that makes you actually understand what’s being built. Tests are that forcing function. You can’t write a meaningful test for something you don’t understand. And you can’t verify that a test correctly captures intent without understanding the intent yourself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The account includes a major refactoring, and much evolution of the initial version of the tool. It’s also an interesting glimpse of how AI tooling may finally make RDF useful.</p>

<p> ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p>When thinking about requirements for software, most discussions focus on prioritization. Some folks talk about buckets such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method">MoSCoW set</a>: Must, Should, Could, and Want. (The old joke being that, in MoSCoW, the cow is silent, because hardly any requirements end up in those buckets.) <a href="https://world.hey.com/jason/the-obvious-the-easy-and-the-possible-2e11a3fb">Jason Fried</a> has a different set of buckets for interface design: <strong>Obvious, Easy, and Possible</strong>. This immediately resonates with me: a good way of think about how to allocate the cognitive costs for those who use a tool.</p>

<p> ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p><a href="https://www.platformer.news/fake-uber-eats-whisleblower-hoax-debunked/">Casey Newton</a> explains how he followed up on an interesting story of dark patterns in food delivery, and found it to be a fake story, buttressed by AI image and document creation. On one hand, it clarifies the important role reporters play in exposing lies that get traction on the internet. But time taken to do this is time not spent on investigating real stories</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For most of my career up until this point, the document shared with me by the whistleblower would have seemed highly credible in large part because it would have taken so long to put together. Who would take the time to put together a detailed, 18-page technical document about market dynamics just to troll a reporter? Who would go to the trouble of creating a fake badge?</p>

  <p>Today, though, the report can be generated within minutes, and the badge within seconds. And while no good reporter would ever have published a story based on a single document and an unknown source, plenty would take the time to investigate the document’s contents and see whether human sources would back it up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The internet has always been full of slop, and we have always needed to be wary of what we read there. AI now makes it easy to manufacture convincing looking evidence, and this is never more dangerous than when it confirms strongly held beliefs and fears.</p>

<p> ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7413956151144542208/">Kent Beck</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The descriptions of Spec-Driven development that I have seen emphasize writing the whole specification before implementation. This encodes the (to me bizarre) assumption that you aren’t going to learn anything during implementation that would change the specification.
I’ve heard this story so many times told so many ways by well-meaning folks–if only we could get the specification “right”, the rest of this would be easy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Like him, that story has been the constant background siren to my career in tech. But the <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/llm-learning-loop.html">learning loop</a> of experimentation is essential to the model building that’s at the heart of any kind of worthwhile specification. As <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/llm-learning-loop.html">Unmesh puts it:</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Large Language Models give us great leverage—but they only work if we focus on learning and understanding. They make it easier to explore ideas, to set things up, to translate intent into code across many specialized languages. But the real capability—our ability to respond to change—comes not from how fast we can produce code, but from how deeply we understand the system we are shaping.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When Kent defined Extreme Programming, he made <em>feedback</em> one of its four core values. It strikes me that the key to making the full use of AI in software development is how to use it to accelerate the feedback loops.</p>

<p> ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p>As I listen to people who are serious with AI-assisted programming, the crucial thing I hear is managing context. Programming-oriented tools are geting more sophisticated for that, but there’s also efforts at providing simpler tools, that allow customization. <a href="https://lixo.org">Carlos Villela</a> recently recommended Pi, and its developer, <a href="https://mariozechner.at/posts/2025-11-30-pi-coding-agent/">Mario Zechner, has an interesting blog</a> on its development.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So what’s an old guy yelling at Claudes going to do? He’s going to write his own coding agent harness and give it a name that’s entirely un-Google-able, so there will never be any users. Which means there will also never be any issues on the GitHub issue tracker. How hard can it be?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If I ever get the time to sit and really play with these tools, then something like Pi would be something I’d like to try out. Although as an addict to The One True Editor, I’m interested in some of libraries that work with that, such as <a href="https://github.com/karthink/gptel">gptel</a>. That would enable me to use Emacs’s inherent programability to create my own command set to drive the interaction with LLMs.</p>

<p> ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p>Outside of my professional work, I’ve <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/blog/13064/martins-7th-decade">posting regularly about my boardgaming</a> on the specialist site BoardGameGeek. However its blogging environment doesn’t do a good job of providing an index to my posts, so I’ve created <a href="https://martinfowler.com/boardgames/">a list of my BGG posts </a> on my own site.

**摘要**: <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gitanjalivenkatraman/">Gitanjali Venkatraman</a> does wonderful illustrations of complex subjects (which is why I was so happy to work with her on our <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/expert-generalist.html">Expert Generalists</a> article). She has now published the latest in her series of illustrated guides: tackling the complex topic of <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/content/dam/thoughtworks/documents/blog/mainframe_modernisation_illustrated_guide_2025.pdf">Mainframe Modernization</a></p>

<p>In it she illustrates the history and value of mainframes, why modernization is so tricky, and how to tackle the problem by breaking it down into tractable pieces. I love the clarity of her explanations, and smile frequently at her way of enhancing her words with her quirky pictures.</p>

<p> ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p>Gergely Orosz on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gergely.pragmaticengineer.com/post/3m7xd33hi5c2d">social media</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unpopular opinion:</p>

  <p>Current code review tools just don’t make much sense for AI-generated code</p>

  <p>When reviewing code I really want to know:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The prompt made by the dev</li>
    <li>What corrections the other dev made to the code</li>
    <li>Clear marking of code AI-generated not changed by a human</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Some people pushed back saying they don’t (and shouldn’t care) whether it was written by a human, generated by an LLM, or copy-pasted from Stack Overflow.</p>

<p>In my view it matters <em>a lot</em> - because of the second vital purpose of code review.</p>

<p>When asked why do code reviews, most people will answer the first vital purpose - quality control. We want to ensure bad code gets blocked before it hits <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/branching-patterns.html#mainline">mainline</a>. We do this to avoid bugs and to avoid other quality issues, in particular comprehensibility and ease of change.</p>

<p>But I hear the second vital purpose less often: code review is a mechanism to communicate and educate. If I’m submitting some sub-standard code, and it gets rejected, I want to know why so that I can improve my programming. Maybe I’m unaware of some library features, or maybe there’s some project-specific standards I haven’t run into yet, or maybe my naming isn’t as clear as I thought it was. Whatever the reasons, I need to know in order to learn. And my employer needs me to learn, so I can be more effective.</p>

<p>We need to know the writer of the code we review both so we can communicate our better practice to them, but also to know how to improve things. With a human, its a conversation, and perhaps some documentation if we realize we’ve needed to explain things repeatedly. But with an LLM it’s about how to modify its context, as well as humans learning how to better drive the LLM.</p>

<p> ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p>Wondering why I’ve been making a lot of posts like this recently? <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/writing-fragments.html">I explain why</a> I’ve been reviving the link blog.</p>

<p> ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p><a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/10/html-tools/">Simon Willison</a> describes how he uses LLMs to build disposable but useful web apps</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>These are the characteristics I have found to be most productive in building tools of this nature:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>A single file: inline JavaScript and CSS in a single HTML file means the least hassle in hosting or distributing them, and crucially means you can copy and paste them out of an LLM response.</li>
    <li>Avoid React, or anything with a build step. The problem with React is that JSX requires a build step, which makes everything massively less convenient. I prompt “no react” and skip that whole rabbit hole entirely.</li>
    <li>Load dependencies from a CDN. The fewer dependencies the better, but if there’s a well known library that helps solve a problem I’m happy to load it from CDNjs or jsdelivr or similar.</li>
    <li>Keep them small. A few hundred lines means the maintainability of the code doesn’t matter too much: any good LLM can read them and understand what they’re doing, and rewriting them from scratch with help from an LLM takes just a few minutes.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>His repository includes all these tools, together with transcripts of the chats that got the LLMs to build them.</p>

<p> ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p><a href="https://obie.medium.com/what-happens-when-the-coding-becomes-the-least-interesting-part-of-the-work-ab10c213c660">Obie Fernandez</a>: while many engineers are underwhelmed by AI tools, some senior engineers are finding them really valuable. He feels that senior engineers have an oft-unspoken mindset, which in conjunction with an LLM, enables the LLM to be much more valuable.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Levels of abstraction and generalization problems get talked about a lot because they’re easy to name. But they’re far from the whole story.</p>

  <p>Other tools show up just as often in real work:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>A sense for blast radius. Knowing which changes are safe to make loudly and which should be quiet and contained.</li>
    <li>A feel for sequencing. Knowing when a technically correct change is still wrong because the system or the team isn’t ready for it yet.</li>
    <li>An instinct for reversibility. Preferring moves that keep options open, even if they look less elegant in the moment.</li>
    <li>An awareness of social cost. Recognizing when a clever solution will confuse more people than it helps.</li>
    <li>An allergy to false confidence. Spotting places where tests are green but the model is wrong.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p> ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p><a href="https://friendlybit.com/python/writing-justhtml-with-coding-agents/">Emil Stenström</a> built an HTML5 parser in python using coding agents, using Github Copilot in Agent mode with Claude Sonnet 3.7. He automatically approved most commands. It took him “a couple of months on off-hours”, including at least one restart from scratch. The parser now passes all the tests in html5lib test suite.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After writing the parser, I still don’t know HTML5 properly. The agent wrote it for me. I guided it when it came to API design and corrected bad decisions at the high level, but it did ALL of the gruntwork and wrote all of the code.</p>

  <p>I handled all git commits myself, reviewing code as it went in. I didn’t understand all the algorithmic choices, but I understood when it didn’t do the right thing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although he gives an overview of what happens, there’s not very much information on his workflow and how he interacted with the LLM. There’s certainly not enough detail here to try to replicate his approach. This is contrast to Simon Willison (above) who has detailed links to his chat transcripts - although they are much smaller tools and I haven’t looked at them properly to see how useful they are.</p>

<p>One thing that is clear, however, is the vital need for a comprehensive test suite. Much of his work is driven by having that suite as a clear guide for him and the LLM agents.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>JustHTML is about 3,000 lines of Python with 8,500+ tests passing. I couldn’t have written it this quickly without the agent.</p>

  <p>But “quickly” doesn’t mean “without thinking.” I spent a lot of time reviewing code, making design decisions, and steering the agent in the right direction. The agent did the typing; I did the thinking.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>                                  ❄                                  ❄    </p>

<p>Then Simon Willison <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/15/porting-justhtml/">ported the library to JavaScript</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Time elapsed from project idea to finished library: about 4 hours, during which I also bought and decorated a Christmas tree with family and watched the latest Knives Out movie.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of his lessons:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you can reduce a problem to a robust test suite you can set a coding agent loop loose on it with a high degree of confidence that it will eventually succeed. I called this <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/30/designing-agentic-loops/">designing the agentic loop</a> a few months ago. I think it’s the key skill to unlocking the potential of LLMs for complex tasks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Our experience at Thoughtworks backs this up. We’ve been doing a fair bit of work recently in legacy modernization (mainframe and otherwise) using AI to migrate substantial software systems. Having a robust test suite is necessary (but not sufficient) to making this work. I hope to share my colleagues’ experiences on this in the coming months.</p>

<p>But before I leave Willison’s post, I should highlight his final open questions on the legalities, ethics, and effectiveness of all this - they are well-worth contemplating.</p>

### [Writing Fragments](https://martinfowler.com/articles/writing-fragments.html)

**来源**: Martin Fowler

**摘要**: <p>If you’re a regular reader of my site, you’ll have noticed that in the
last few months I’ve been making a <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/20251204-frags.html">number</a> of “fragments” <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/2025-11-19-frags.html">posts</a>. Such a post
is a short post with a bunch of little, unconnected segments. These are
usually a reference to something I’ve found on the web, sometimes a small
thought of my own.</p>

<p>A few years ago, I wouldn’t have covered these topics with posts on my
own site. Instead I would use Twitter, either retweeting someone else’s
point, or just highlighting something I’d found. But since the Muskover,
Twitter has effectively died. I’m not saying that due to any technical
issues with the site, which has mostly just been fine, nor directly due to
any of the policy changes there. The point is that lots of people have left, so that
the audience I would have reached with Twitter is now fragmented. Some
remain on X, but I see more activity on LinkedIn. There’s also Fediverse/Mastodon
and Bluesky.</p>

<p>What this means for short posts is that I can no longer just post in one
place. When I announce new articles on martinfowler.com, I announce now on
four social media sites (X, LinkedIn, Fediverse, and Bluesky). It makes
sense to do this, but I don’t want to go through all this hassle for the
kind of micro-post that Twitter served so well.</p>

<p>So I’ve started to batch them up. When I see something interesting, I
make a note. When I have enough notes, I post a fragments post. Initially I
did this in a rather ad-hoc way, just using the same mechanisms I use for
most articles, but last week I started to put in some more deliberate
mechanisms into the site. (If you’re observant, you’ll spot that in the URLs.)</p>

<p>One benefit of all of this, at least in my book, is that it means my material is
now fully visible in RSS. I’m probably showing my age, but I’m a big fan of RSS
(or in my case, strictly Atom) feeds. I miss the feel of the heyday of the
“blogosphere” before it got steamrolled by social media, and these fragment
posts are, of course, just the same as the link blogs from that era. I still use my
RSS reader every day to keep up with writers I like. (I’m pleased that Substack
makes its content available via RSS.) It bothered me a bit that my micro-founts
of Twitter knowledge weren’t visible on RSS, but was too lazy to do something
about it. Now I don’t need to - the fragments are available in my RSS feed.</p>

  <p>There are three charges against X, which all stem from a multi-year investigation that was launched in 2023.

**摘要**: <p><a href="https://blog.robbowley.net/2025/12/04/ai-is-still-making-code-worse-a-new-cmu-study-confirms/">Rob Bowley</a> summarizes a study from Carnegie Mellon looking on the impact of AI on a bunch of open-source software projects. Like any such study, we shouldn’t take its results as definitive, but there seems enough there to make it a handy data point. The key point is that the AI code probably reduced the quality of the code base - at least if static code analysis can be trusted to determine quality. And perhaps some worrying second-order effects</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This study shows more than 800 popular GitHub projects with code quality degrading after adopting AI tools. It’s hard not to see a form of context collapse playing out in real time. If the public code that future models learn from is becoming more complex and less maintainable, there’s a real risk that newer models will reinforce and amplify those trends, producing even worse code over time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p>Rob’s post is typical of much of the thoughtful writing on AI. We can see its short-term benefits, but worry about its long-term impact. But on a much deeper note is this lovely story from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/my-80th-birthday-i-bought-myself-new-brain-jim-highsmith-8qcrc/">Jim Highsmith</a>. Jim has turned 0x50, and has spent the last decade fighting Parkinson’s disease. To help him battle it he has two AI assisted allies.</p>

<p><strong>If you read anything on AI this week, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/my-80th-birthday-i-bought-myself-new-brain-jim-highsmith-8qcrc/">make it be this</a>.</strong> It offers a positive harbinger for our future and opens my mind to a whole different perspective of the role of AI in it</p>

<p>Anthropic recently announced that it disrupted a Chinese state-sponsored operation abusing Claude Code. Jim Gumbley looks at the core lesson to learn from this, that we have to understand the serious risk of  <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/security/anthropic-ai-espionage-disclosure-signal-from-noise?utm_source=linkedin&amp;utm_medium=social-organic&amp;utm_campaign=dt_bs_rp-in-clt_tech_thought_leaders_2025-11&amp;gh_src=d1fe17bc1us">AI Jailbreaking</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>New AI tools are able to analyze your attack surface at the next level of granularity. As a business leader, that means you now have two options: wait for someone else to run AI-assisted vulnerability detection against your attack surface, or run it yourself first.</p>

<p> ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p>There’s plenty of claims that AI Vibe Coding can replace software developers, something that folks like me (perhaps with a bias) think unlikely. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gergely.pragmaticengineer.com/post/3m75kmb7bh22i">Gergely Orosz</a> shared this tidbit</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Talked with an exec at a tech company who is obsessed with AI and has been for 3 years. Not a developer but company makes software. Uses AI for everything, vibe codes ideas.</p>

  <p>Here’s the kicker:</p>

  <p>Has a team of several devs to implement his vibe coded prototypes to sg workable</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’d love to hear more about this (and similar stories)</p>

<p> ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p><a href="https://checkeagle.com/checklists/njr/a-month-of-chat-oriented-programming/">Nick Radcliffe</a> writes about a month of using AI</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I spent a solid month “pair programming” with Claude Code, trying to suspend disbelief and adopt a this-will-be-productive mindset. More specifically, I got Claude to write well over 99% of the code produced during the month. I found the experience infuriating, unpleasant, and stressful before even worrying about its energy impact. Ideally, I would prefer not to do it again for at least a year or two. The only problem with that is that it “worked”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He stresses that his approach is the “polar opposite” of Vibe Coding. The post is long, and rambles a bit, but is worthwhile because he talks in detail about his workflow and how he uses the tool. Such posts are important so we can learn the nitty-gritty of how our programming habits are changing.</p>

<p> ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p>Along similar lines is a post of <a href="https://brianchambers.substack.com/p/chamber-of-tech-secrets-55-issue">Brian Chambers</a> on his workflow, that he calls Issue-Driven Development (and yes, I’m also sick of the “something-driven” phraseology). As with much of the better stuff I’ve heard about AI assisted work, it’s all about carefully managing the context window, ensuring the AI is focused on the right things and not distracted by textual squirrels.</p>

### [Fragments Nov 19](https://martinfowler.com/articles/2025-11-19-frags.html)

**来源**: Martin Fowler

**摘要**: <p><img alt="radar image" src="https://martinfowler.com/articles/images/frags-2025-11/radar.png" width="300px" /></p>

<p>I’ve been on the road in Europe for the last couple of weeks, and while I was there Thoughtworks released <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar">volume 33 of our Technology Radar</a>. Again it’s dominated by the AI wave, with lots of blips capturing our explorations of how to use LLMs and similar technology. “Agents” are the big thing these days but we’re also seeing growing movements in infrastructure orchestration, coding workflows - and the inevitable antipatterns. Many thanks to my colleagues for putting this together again.</p>

<p>                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p><img alt="Gergely and I recording the podcast" src="https://martinfowler.com/articles/images/frags-2025-11/podcast.png" width="400px" /></p>

<p>My trip to Europe started in Amsterdam, for a Thoughtworks event for a few of our clients there. Since I was in that lovely city, I got in touch with Gergely Orosz, host of <a href="https://www.pragmaticengineer.com/">The Pragmatic Engineer</a>, and he arranged to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQmI4XKTa0U">record a podcast</a> with me. No surprise that AI was front-and-center of the conversation, as I said it was the biggest shift I’d seen in programming during my career, comparable only to the shift to high-level languages, which even I am not old enough to have experienced. It was a fun chat and I really enjoyed myself. Gergely later joined myself James Lewis and Giles Edwards-Alexander at the Thoughtworks event the next day.</p>

<p>                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p>My travels also took me to Nüremberg, where I attended an internal conference for Siemens on the future of software architecture. When we think of technology, it’s easy to focus on the Faangs of Silicon Valley, but Siemens have a huge workforce of software developers working on heavy engineering systems like trains and factory automation. It was good to hear them talk about federated architectures, data mesh, and their use of AI.</p>

<p>I’ve often used pseudo-graphs to help explain why <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/is-quality-worth-cost.html">high quality software is cheaper</a>.

<p>And in another life, Edward has finally finished the great migration of the Heavy Cardboard studio and returns to the tubes with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/e8juRvm9h0c">our first game in the new digs</a>. (No surprise that it’s Age of Steam.)</p>

<li><strong>Async scheduling enabled by default</strong> (<a class="issue-link js-issue-link" href="https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/27614">#27614</a>): Overlaps engine core scheduling with GPU execution, improving throughput without user configuration. Now also works with speculative decoding (<a class="issue-link js-issue-link" href="https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/31998">#31998</a>) and structured outputs (<a class="issue-link js-issue-link" href="https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/29821">#29821</a>).</li>
<li><strong>gRPC server entrypoint</strong> (<a class="issue-link js-issue-link" href="https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/30190">#30190</a>): Alternative to REST API with binary protocol, HTTP/2 multiplexing.</li>
<li><strong><code>--max-model-len auto</code></strong> (<a class="issue-link js-issue-link" href="https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/29431">#29431</a>): Automatically fits context length to available GPU memory, eliminating OOM startup failures.</li>
<li><strong>Model inspection view</strong> (<a class="issue-link js-issue-link" href="https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/29450">#29450</a>): View the modules, attention backends, and quantization of your model in vLLM by specifying <code>VLLM_LOG_MODEL_INSPECTION=1</code> or by simply printing the <code>LLM</code> object.</li>
<li><strong>Model Runner V2 enhancements</strong>: UVA block tables (<a class="issue-link js-issue-link" href="https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/31965">#31965</a>), M-RoPE (<a class="issue-link js-issue-link" href="https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/32143">#32143</a>), <code>logit_bias</code>/<code>allowed_token_ids</code>/<code>min_tokens</code> support (<a class="issue-link js-issue-link" href="https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/32163">#32163</a>).

### [[$] Linux Kernel Runtime Guard reaches its 1.0 release](https://lwn.net/Articles/1049295/)

**来源**: LWN.net (Linux Weekly News)

**摘要**: <p>
The
<a href="https://lkrg.org">
Linux Kernel Runtime Guard</a> (LKRG) is a out-of-tree loadable kernel module that
attempts to detect and report violations of the kernel's internal invariants,
such as might be caused by an in-progress security exploit or a rootkit.
LKRG has been experimental since its
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/749707/">
initial release in 2018</a>. In September
2025, the project
<a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/announce/2025/09/02/1">announced</a>
the 1.0 version. With the promises of stability that version brings, users might want more
information to decide whether to include it in their kernel.

### [A data model for Git (and other docs updates)](https://jvns.ca/blog/2026/01/08/a-data-model-for-git/)

**来源**: Julia Evans

**摘要**: <p>Hello! This past fall, I decided to take some time to work on Git&rsquo;s
documentation. I&rsquo;ve been thinking about working on open source docs for a long
time &ndash; usually if I think the documentation for something could be improved,
I&rsquo;ll write a blog post or a zine or something. But this time I wondered: could I
instead make a few improvements to the official documentation?</p>
<p>So <a href="https://marieflanagan.com/">Marie</a> and I made a few changes to the Git
documentation!</p>
<h3 id="a-data-model-for-git">a data model for Git</h3>
<p>After a while working on the documentation, we noticed that Git uses the terms
&ldquo;object&rdquo;, &ldquo;reference&rdquo;, or &ldquo;index&rdquo; in its documentation a lot, but that it didn&rsquo;t
have a great explanation of what those terms mean or how they relate to other
core concepts like &ldquo;commit&rdquo; and &ldquo;branch&rdquo;. So we wrote a new &ldquo;data model&rdquo; document!</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/gitdatamodel.adoc">read the data model here for now</a>.
I assume at some point (after the next release?) it&rsquo;ll also be on the <a href="https://git-scm.com">Git website</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited about this because understanding how Git organizes its commit and
branch data has really helped me reason about how Git works over the years,
and I think it&rsquo;s important to have a short (1600 words!) version of the data
model that&rsquo;s accurate.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;accurate&rdquo; part turned out to not be that easy: I knew the basics of how
Git&rsquo;s data model worked, but during the review process I learned some new
details and had to make quite a few changes (for example how merge conflicts are
stored in the staging area).</p>
<h3 id="updates-to-git-push-git-pull-and-more">updates to <code>git push</code>, <code>git pull</code>, and more</h3>
<p>I also worked on updating the introduction to some of Git&rsquo;s core man pages.
I quickly realized that &ldquo;just try to improve it according to my best judgement&rdquo;
was not going to work: why should the maintainers believe me that my version is
better?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen a problem a lot when discussing open source documentation changes
where 2 expert users of the software argue about whether an explanation
is clear or not (&ldquo;I think X would be a good way to explain it! Well, I think Y
would be better!&rdquo;)</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think this is very productive (expert users of a piece of software
are notoriously bad at being able to tell if an explanation will be clear to
non-experts), so I needed to find a way to identify problems with the man
pages that was a little more evidence-based.</p>
<h3 id="getting-test-readers-to-identify-problems">getting test readers to identify problems</h3>
<p>I asked for test readers on Mastodon to read the current version of
documentation and tell me what they find confusing or what questions they have.
About 80 test readers left comments, and I learned so much!</p>
<p>People left a huge amount of great feedback, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>terminology they didn&rsquo;t understand (what&rsquo;s a pathspec? what does &ldquo;reference&rdquo; mean? does &ldquo;upstream&rdquo; have a specific meaning in Git?)</li>
<li>specific confusing sentences</li>
<li>suggestions of things things to add (&ldquo;I do X all the time, I think it should be included here&rdquo;)</li>
<li>inconsistencies (&ldquo;here it implies X is the default, but elsewhere it implies Y is the default&rdquo;)</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the test readers had been using Git for at least 5-10 years, which
I think worked well &ndash; if a group of test readers who have been using Git
regularly for 5+ years find a sentence or term impossible to understand, it
makes it easy to argue that the documentation should be updated to make it
clearer.</p>
<p>I thought this &ldquo;get users of the software to comment on the existing
documentation and then fix the problems they find&rdquo; pattern worked really
well and I&rsquo;m excited about potentially trying it again in the future.</p>
<h3 id="the-man-page-changes">the man page changes</h3>
<p>We ended updating these 4 man pages:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>git add</code> (<a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/2b3ae040/Documentation/git-add.adoc">before</a>, <a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/e0bfec3dfc356f7d808eb5ee546a54116b794397/Documentation/git-add.adoc">after</a>)</li>
<li><code>git checkout</code> (<a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/2b3ae040/Documentation/git-checkout.adoc">before</a>, <a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/e0bfec3dfc356f7d808eb5ee546a54116b794397/Documentation/git-checkout.adoc">after</a>)</li>
<li><code>git push</code> (<a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/2b3ae040/Documentation/git-push.adoc">before</a>, <a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/e0bfec3dfc356f7d808eb5ee546a54116b794397/Documentation/git-push.adoc">after</a>)</li>
<li><code>git pull</code> (<a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/2b3ae040/Documentation/git-pull.adoc">before</a>, <a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/e0bfec3dfc356f7d808eb5ee546a54116b794397/Documentation/git-pull.adoc">after</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>git push</code> and <code>git pull</code> changes were the most interesting to me: in
addition to updating the intro to those pages, we also ended up writing:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/e0bfec3dfc356f7d808eb5ee546a54116b794397/Documentation/urls-remotes.adoc#upstream-branches">a section describing what the term &ldquo;upstream branch&rdquo; means</a> (which previously wasn&rsquo;t really explained)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/e0bfec3dfc356f7d808eb5ee546a54116b794397/Documentation/git-push.adoc#options">a cleaned-up description of what a &ldquo;push refspec&rdquo; is</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Making those changes really gave me an appreciation for how much work it is
to maintain open source documentation: it&rsquo;s not easy to write things that are
both clear and true, and sometimes we had to make compromises, for example the sentence
&ldquo;<code>git push</code> may fail if you haven’t set an upstream for the current branch,
depending on what <code>push.default</code> is set to.&rdquo; is a little vague, but the exact
details of what &ldquo;depending&rdquo; means are really complicated and untangling that is
a big project.</p>
<h3 id="on-the-process-for-contributing-to-git">on the process for contributing to Git</h3>
<p>It took me a while to understand Git&rsquo;s development process.
I&rsquo;m not going to try to describe it here (that could be a whole other post!), but a few quick notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Git has a <a href="https://git-scm.com/community#discord">Discord server</a>
with a &ldquo;my first contribution&rdquo; channel for help with getting started contributing.
I found people to be very welcoming on the Discord.</li>
<li>I used <a href="https://gitgitgadget.github.io/">GitGitGadget</a> to make all of my contributions.
This meant that I could make a GitHub pull request (a workflow I&rsquo;m comfortable
with) and GitGitGadget would convert my PRs into the system the Git developers
use (emails with patches attached). GitGitGadget worked great and I was very
grateful to not have to learn how to send patches by email with Git.</li>
<li>Otherwise I used my normal email client (Fastmail&rsquo;s web interface) to reply
to emails, wrapping my text to 80 character lines since that&rsquo;s the mailing
list norm.</li>
</ul>
<p>I also found the mailing list archives on <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/git/">lore.kernel.org</a>
hard to navigate, so I hacked together <a href="https://github.com/jvns/git-list-viewer">my own git list viewer</a>
to make it easier to read the long mailing list threads.</p>
<p>Many people helped me navigate the contribution process and review the changes:
thanks to Emily Shaffer, Johannes Schindelin (the author of GitGitGadget),
Patrick Steinhardt, Ben Knoble, Junio Hamano, and more.</p>
<p>(I&rsquo;m experimenting with <a href="https://comments.jvns.ca/post/115861337435768520">comments on Mastodon, you can see the comments here</a>)</p>

### [Notes on switching to Helix from vim](https://jvns.ca/blog/2025/10/10/notes-on-switching-to-helix-from-vim/)

**来源**: Julia Evans

**摘要**: <p>Hello! Earlier this summer I was talking to a friend about how much I
<a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2024/09/12/reasons-i--still--love-fish/">love using fish</a>, and
how I love that I don&rsquo;t have to configure it. They said that they feel the same
way about the <a href="https://helix-editor.com/">helix</a> text editor, and so I decided
to give it a try.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using it for 3 months now and here are a few notes.</p>
<h3 id="why-helix-language-servers">why helix: language servers</h3>
<p>I think what motivated me to try Helix is that I&rsquo;ve been trying to get a working
language server setup (so I can do things like &ldquo;go to definition&rdquo;) and getting
a setup that feels good in Vim or Neovim just felt like too much work.</p>
<p>After using Vim/Neovim for 20 years, I&rsquo;ve tried both &ldquo;build my own custom
configuration from scratch&rdquo; and &ldquo;use someone else&rsquo;s pre-buld configuration
system&rdquo; and even though I love Vim I was excited about having things just work
without having to work on my configuration at all.</p>
<p>Helix comes with built in language server support, and it feels nice
to be able to do things like &ldquo;rename this symbol&rdquo; in any language.</p>
<h3 id="the-search-is-great">the search is great</h3>
<p>One of my favourite things about Helix is the search! If I&rsquo;m searching all the
files in my repository for a string, it lets me scroll through the potential
matching files and see the full context of the match, like this:</p>
<img src="https://jvns.ca/images/helix-search.png" />
<p>For comparison, here&rsquo;s what the vim ripgrep plugin I&rsquo;ve been using looks like:</p>
<img src="https://jvns.ca/images/vim-ripgrep.png" />
<p>There&rsquo;s no context for what else is around that line.</p>
<h3 id="the-quick-reference-is-nice">the quick reference is nice</h3>
<p>One thing I like about Helix is that when I press <code>g</code>, I get a little help popup
telling me places I can go. I really appreciate this because I don&rsquo;t often use
the &ldquo;go to definition&rdquo; or &ldquo;go to reference&rdquo; feature and I often forget the
keyboard shortcut.</p>
<img src="https://jvns.ca/images/goto.png" width="300px" />
<h3 id="some-vim-helix-translations">some vim -&gt; helix translations</h3>
<ul>
<li>Helix doesn&rsquo;t have marks like <code>ma</code>, <code>'a</code>, instead I&rsquo;ve been using <code>Ctrl+O</code> and
<code>Ctrl+I</code> to go back (or forward) to the last cursor location</li>
<li>I think Helix does have macros, but I&rsquo;ve been using multiple cursors in every
case that I would have previously used a macro. I like multiple cursors a lot
more than writing macros all the time. If I want to batch change something in
the document, my workflow is to press <code>%</code> (to highlight everything), then <code>s</code>
to select (with a regex) the things I want to change, then I can just edit
all of them as needed.</li>
<li>Helix doesn&rsquo;t have neovim-style tabs, instead it has a nice buffer switcher (<code>&lt;space&gt;b</code>)
I can use to switch to the buffer I want. There&rsquo;s a
<a href="https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/pull/7109">pull request here</a> to implement neovim-style tabs.
There&rsquo;s also a setting <code>bufferline=&quot;multiple&quot;</code> which can act a bit like tabs
with <code>gp</code>, <code>gn</code> for prev/next &ldquo;tab&rdquo; and <code>:bc</code> to close a &ldquo;tab&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="some-helix-annoyances">some helix annoyances</h3>
<p>Here&rsquo;s everything that&rsquo;s annoyed me about Helix so far.</p>
<ul>
<li>I like the way Helix&rsquo;s <code>:reflow</code> works much less than how
vim reflows text with <code>gq</code>. It doesn&rsquo;t work as well with lists. (<a href="https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/issues/3332">github issue</a>)</li>
<li>If I&rsquo;m making a Markdown list, pressing &ldquo;enter&rdquo; at the end of a list item
won&rsquo;t continue the list. There&rsquo;s a <a href="https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/wiki/Recipes#continue-markdown-lists--quotes">partial workaround</a>
for bulleted lists but I don&rsquo;t know one for numbered lists.</li>
<li>No persistent undo yet: in vim I could use an
<a href="https://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/options.html#'undofile'">undofile</a> so
that I could undo changes even after quitting. Helix doesn&rsquo;t have that feature yet.
(<a href="https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/pull/9154">github PR</a>)</li>
<li>Helix doesn&rsquo;t autoreload files after they change on disk, I have to run
<code>:reload-all</code> (<code>:ra&lt;tab&gt;</code>) to manually reload them. Not a big deal.</li>
<li>Sometimes it crashes, maybe every week or so. I think it might be
<a href="https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/issues/12582">this issue</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The &ldquo;markdown list&rdquo; and reflowing issues come up a lot for me because I spend
a lot of time editing Markdown lists, but I keep using Helix anyway so I guess
they can&rsquo;t be making me that mad.</p>
<h3 id="switching-was-easier-than-i-thought">switching was easier than I thought</h3>
<p>I was worried that relearning 20 years of Vim muscle memory would be really hard.</p>
<p>It turned out to be easier than I expected, I started using Helix on a
vacation for a little low-stakes coding project I was doing on the side and
after a week or two it didn&rsquo;t feel so disorienting anymore. I think it might be
hard to switch back and forth between Vim and Helix, but I haven&rsquo;t needed to use
Vim recently so I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;ll ever become an issue for me.</p>
<p>The first time I tried Helix I tried to force it to use keybindings that were
more similar to Vim and that did not work for me. Just learning the &ldquo;Helix way&rdquo;
was a lot easier.</p>
<p>There are still some things that throw me off: for example <code>w</code> in vim and <code>w</code> in
Helix don&rsquo;t have the same idea of what a &ldquo;word&rdquo; is (the Helix one includes the
space after the word, the Vim one doesn&rsquo;t).</p>

<p>For many years I&rsquo;d mostly been using a GUI version of vim/neovim, so switching
to actually using an editor in the terminal was a bit of an adjustment.</p>
<p>I ended up deciding on:</p>
<ol>
<li>Every project gets its own terminal window, and all of the tabs in that
window (mostly) have the same working directory</li>
<li>I make my Helix tab the first tab in the terminal window</li>
</ol>
<p>It works pretty well, I might actually like it better than my previous workflow.</p>
<h3 id="my-configuration">my configuration</h3>
<p>I appreciate that my configuration is really simple, compared to my neovim
configuration which is hundreds of lines. It&rsquo;s mostly just 4 keyboard
shortcuts.</p>
<pre><code>theme = &quot;solarized_light&quot;
[editor]
# Sync clipboard with system clipboard
default-yank-register = &quot;+&quot;

[keys.normal]
# I didn't like that Ctrl+C was the default &quot;toggle comments&quot; shortcut
&quot;#&quot; = &quot;toggle_comments&quot;

# I didn't feel like learning a different way
# to go to the beginning/end of a line so
# I remapped ^ and $
&quot;^&quot; = &quot;goto_first_nonwhitespace&quot;
&quot;$&quot; = &quot;goto_line_end&quot;

[keys.select]
&quot;^&quot; = &quot;goto_first_nonwhitespace&quot;
&quot;$&quot; = &quot;goto_line_end&quot;

[keys.normal.space]
# I write a lot of text so I need to constantly reflow,
# and missed vim's `gq` shortcut
l = &quot;:reflow&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>There&rsquo;s a separate <code>languages.toml</code> configuration where I set some language
preferences, like turning off autoformatting.
For example, here&rsquo;s my Python configuration:</p>
<pre><code>[[language]]
name = &quot;python&quot;
formatter = { command = &quot;black&quot;, args = [&quot;--stdin-filename&quot;, &quot;%{buffer_name}&quot;, &quot;-&quot;] }
language-servers = [&quot;pyright&quot;]
auto-format = false
</code></pre>
<h3 id="we-ll-see-how-it-goes">we&rsquo;ll see how it goes</h3>
<p>Three months is not that long, and it&rsquo;s possible that I&rsquo;ll decide to go back
to Vim at some point. For example, I wrote a <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/02/28/some-notes-on-using-nix/">post about switching to
nix</a> a while back but
after maybe 8 months I switched back to Homebrew (though I&rsquo;m still using NixOS
to manage one little server, and I&rsquo;m still satisfied with that).</p>

### [New zine: The Secret Rules of the Terminal](https://jvns.ca/blog/2025/06/24/new-zine--the-secret-rules-of-the-terminal/)

**来源**: Julia Evans

**摘要**: <p>Hello! After many months of writing deep dive blog posts about the terminal, on
Tuesday I released a new zine called &ldquo;The Secret Rules of the Terminal&rdquo;!</p>
<p>You can get it for $12 here:

an <a href="https://wizardzines.com/zines/all-the-zines/">15-pack of all my zines here</a>.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the cover:</p>

<h3 id="why-the-terminal">why the terminal?</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using the terminal every day for 20 years but even though I&rsquo;m very
confident in the terminal, I&rsquo;ve always had a bit of an uneasy feeling about it.
Usually things work fine, but sometimes something goes wrong and it just feels
like investigating it is impossible, or at least like it would open up a huge
can of worms.</p>
<p>So I started trying to write down a list of weird problems I&rsquo;ve run into in terminal and I realized
that the terminal has a lot of tiny inconsistencies like:</p>
<ul>
<li>sometimes you can use the arrow keys to move around, but sometimes pressing the arrow keys just prints <code>^[[D</code></li>
<li>sometimes you can use the mouse to select text, but sometimes you can&rsquo;t</li>
<li>sometimes your commands get saved to a history when you run them, and sometimes they don&rsquo;t</li>
<li>some shells let you use the up arrow to see the previous command, and some don&rsquo;t</li>
</ul>
<p>If you use the terminal daily for 10 or 20 years, even if you don&rsquo;t understand
exactly <em>why</em> these things happen, you&rsquo;ll probably build an intuition for them.</p>
<p>But having an intuition for them isn&rsquo;t the same as understanding why they
happen. When writing this zine I actually had to do a lot of work to figure out
exactly what was <em>happening</em> in the terminal to be able to talk about how to
reason about it.</p>
<h3 id="the-rules-aren-t-written-down-anywhere">the rules aren&rsquo;t written down anywhere</h3>
<p>It turns out that the &ldquo;rules&rdquo; for how the terminal works (how do
you edit a command you type in? how do you quit a program? how do you fix your
colours?) are extremely hard to fully understand, because &ldquo;the terminal&rdquo; is actually
made of many different pieces of software (your terminal emulator, your
operating system, your shell, the core utilities like <code>grep</code>, and every other random
terminal program you&rsquo;ve installed) which are written by different people with different
ideas about how things should work.</p>
<p>So I wanted to write something that would explain:</p>
<ul>
<li>how the 4 pieces of the terminal (your shell, terminal emulator, programs, and TTY driver) fit together to make everything work</li>
<li>some of the core conventions for how you can expect things in your terminal to work</li>
<li>lots of tips and tricks for how to use terminal programs</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="this-zine-explains-the-most-useful-parts-of-terminal-internals">this zine explains the most useful parts of terminal internals</h3>
<p>Terminal internals are a mess. A lot of it is just the way it is because
someone made a decision in the 80s and now it&rsquo;s impossible to change, and
honestly I don&rsquo;t think learning everything about terminal internals is worth
it.</p>
<p>But some parts are not that hard to understand and can really make your
experience in the terminal better, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you understand what <strong>your shell</strong> is responsible for, you can configure your shell (or use a different one!) to access your history more easily, get great tab completion, and so much more</li>
<li>if you understand <strong>escape codes</strong>, it&rsquo;s much less scary when <code>cat</code>ing a binary to stdout messes up your terminal, you can just type <code>reset</code> and move on</li>
<li>if you understand how <strong>colour</strong> works, you can get rid of bad colour contrast in your terminal so you can actually read the text</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="i-learned-a-surprising-amount-writing-this-zine">I learned a surprising amount writing this zine</h3>
<p>When I wrote <a href="https://wizardzines.com/zines/git">How Git Works</a>, I thought I
knew how Git worked, and I was right. But the terminal is different. Even
though I feel totally confident in the terminal and even though I&rsquo;ve used it
every day for 20 years, I had a lot of misunderstandings about how the terminal
works and (unless you&rsquo;re the author of <code>tmux</code> or something) I think there&rsquo;s a
good chance you do too.</p>
<p>A few things I learned that are actually useful to me:</p>
<ul>
<li>I understand the structure of the terminal better and so I feel more
confident debugging weird terminal stuff that happens to me (I was even able
to suggest a <a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10834">small improvement</a> to fish!). Identifying exactly which piece of software is causing a weird thing to happen in my terminal still isn&rsquo;t <em>easy</em> but I&rsquo;m a lot better at it now.</li>
<li>you can write a shell script to <a href="https://jvns.ca/til/vim-osc52/">copy to your clipboard over SSH</a></li>
<li>how <code>reset</code> works under the hood (it does the equivalent of <code>stty sane; sleep 1; tput reset</code>) – basically I learned that I don&rsquo;t ever need to worry about
remembering <code>stty sane</code> or <code>tput reset</code> and I can just run <code>reset</code> instead</li>
<li>how to look at the invisible escape codes that a program is printing out (run <code>unbuffer program &gt; out; less out</code>)</li>
<li>why the builtin REPLs on my Mac like <code>sqlite3</code> are so annoying to use (they use <code>libedit</code> instead of <code>readline</code>)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="blog-posts-i-wrote-along-the-way">blog posts I wrote along the way</h3>

### [Using `make` to compile C programs (for non-C-programmers)](https://jvns.ca/blog/2025/06/10/how-to-compile-a-c-program/)

**来源**: Julia Evans

**摘要**: <p>I have never been a C programmer but every so often I need to compile a C/C++
program from source. This has been kind of a struggle for me: for a
long time, my approach was basically &ldquo;install the dependencies, run <code>make</code>, if
it doesn&rsquo;t work, either try to find a binary someone has compiled or give up&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope someone else has compiled it&rdquo; worked pretty well when I was running Linux
but since I&rsquo;ve been using a Mac for the last couple of years I&rsquo;ve been running
into more situations where I have to actually compile programs myself.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about what you might have to do to compile a C program! I&rsquo;ll use
a couple of examples of specific C programs I&rsquo;ve compiled and talk about a few
things that can go wrong. Here are three programs we&rsquo;ll be talking about
compiling:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://mj.ucw.cz/sw/paperjam/">paperjam</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.sqlite.org/download.html">sqlite</a></li>
<li><a href="https://git.causal.agency/src/tree/bin/qf.c">qf</a> (a pager you can run to quickly open files from a search with <code>rg -n THING | qf</code>)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-1-install-a-c-compiler">step 1: install a C compiler</h3>
<p>This is pretty simple: on an Ubuntu system if I don&rsquo;t already have a C compiler I&rsquo;ll install one with:</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt-get install build-essential
</code></pre>
<p>This installs <code>gcc</code>, <code>g++</code>, and <code>make</code>. The situation on a Mac is more
confusing but it&rsquo;s something like &ldquo;install xcode command line tools&rdquo;.</p>
<h3 id="step-2-install-the-program-s-dependencies">step 2: install the program&rsquo;s dependencies</h3>
<p>Unlike some newer programming languages, C doesn&rsquo;t have a dependency manager.
So if a program has any dependencies, you need to hunt them down yourself.
Thankfully because of this, C programmers usually keep their dependencies very
minimal and often the dependencies will be available in whatever package manager you&rsquo;re using.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s almost always a section explaining how to get the dependencies in the
README, for example in <a href="https://mj.ucw.cz/sw/paperjam/">paperjam</a>&rsquo;s README, it
says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To compile PaperJam, you need the headers for the libqpdf and libpaper libraries (usually available as libqpdf-dev and libpaper-dev packages).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You may need <code>a2x</code> (found in <a href="http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/a2x.1.html">AsciiDoc</a>) for building manual pages.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So on a Debian-based system you can install the dependencies like this.</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt install -y libqpdf-dev libpaper-dev
</code></pre>
<p>If a README gives a name for a package (like <code>libqpdf-dev</code>), I&rsquo;d basically
always assume that they mean &ldquo;in a Debian-based Linux distro&rdquo;: if you&rsquo;re on a
Mac <code>brew install libqpdf-dev</code> will not work. I still have not 100% gotten
the hang of developing on a Mac yet so I don&rsquo;t have many tips there yet. I
guess in this case it would be <code>brew install qpdf</code> if you&rsquo;re using Homebrew.</p>
<h3 id="step-3-run-configure-if-needed">step 3: run <code>./configure</code> (if needed)</h3>
<p>Some C programs come with a <code>Makefile</code> and some instead come with a script called
<code>./configure</code>. For example, if you download <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/download.html">sqlite&rsquo;s source code</a>, it has a <code>./configure</code> script in
it instead of a Makefile.</p>
<p>My understanding of this <code>./configure</code> script is:</p>
<ol>
<li>You run it, it prints out a lot of somewhat inscrutable output, and then it
either generates a <code>Makefile</code> or fails because you&rsquo;re missing some
dependency</li>
<li>The <code>./configure</code> script is part of a system called
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/Autotools-Introduction.html">autotools</a>
that I have never needed to learn anything about beyond &ldquo;run it to generate
a <code>Makefile</code>&rdquo;.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think there might be some options you can pass to get the <code>./configure</code>
script to produce a different <code>Makefile</code> but I have never done that.</p>
<h3 id="step-4-run-make">step 4: run <code>make</code></h3>
<p>The next step is to run <code>make</code> to try to build a program. Some notes about
<code>make</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes you can run <code>make -j8</code> to parallelize the build and make it go
faster</li>
<li>It usually prints out a million compiler warnings when compiling the program.
I always just ignore them. I didn&rsquo;t write the software! The compiler warnings
are not my problem.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="compiler-errors-are-often-dependency-problems">compiler errors are often dependency problems</h3>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an error I got while compiling <code>paperjam</code> on my Mac:</p>
<pre><code>/opt/homebrew/Cellar/qpdf/12.0.0/include/qpdf/InputSource.hh:85:19: error: function definition does not declare parameters
   85 |     qpdf_offset_t last_offset{0};
      |                   ^
</code></pre>
<p>Over the years I&rsquo;ve learned it&rsquo;s usually best not to overthink problems like
this: if it&rsquo;s talking about <code>qpdf</code>, there&rsquo;s a good change it just means that
I&rsquo;ve done something wrong with how I&rsquo;m including the <code>qpdf</code> dependency.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s talk about some ways to get the <code>qpdf</code> dependency included in the right way.</p>
<h3 id="the-world-s-shortest-introduction-to-the-compiler-and-linker">the world&rsquo;s shortest introduction to the compiler and linker</h3>
<p>Before we talk about how to fix dependency problems: building C programs is split into 2
steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Compiling</strong> the code into <strong>object files</strong> (with <code>gcc</code> or <code>clang</code>)</li>
<li><strong>Linking</strong> those object files into a final binary (with <code>ld</code>)</li>
</ol>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to know this when building a C program because sometimes you
need to pass the right flags to the compiler and linker to tell them where to
find the dependencies for the program you&rsquo;re compiling.</p>
<h3 id="make-uses-environment-variables-to-configure-the-compiler-and-linker"><code>make</code> uses environment variables to configure the compiler and linker</h3>
<p>If I run <code>make</code> on my Mac to install <code>paperjam</code>, I get this error:</p>
<pre><code>c++ -o paperjam paperjam.o pdf-tools.o parse.o cmds.o pdf.o -lqpdf -lpaper
ld: library 'qpdf' not found
</code></pre>
<p>This is not because <code>qpdf</code> is not installed on my system (it actually is!). But
the compiler and linker don&rsquo;t know how to <em>find</em> the <code>qpdf</code> library. To fix this, we need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>pass <code>&quot;-I/opt/homebrew/include&quot;</code> to the compiler (to tell it where to find the header files)</li>
<li>pass <code>&quot;-L/opt/homebrew/lib -liconv&quot;</code> to the linker (to tell it where to find library files and to link in <code>iconv</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>And we can get <code>make</code> to pass those extra parameters to the compiler and linker using environment variables!
To see how this works: inside <code>paperjam</code>&rsquo;s Makefile you can see a bunch of environment variables, like <code>LDLIBS</code> here:</p>
<pre><code>paperjam: $(OBJS)
	$(LD) -o $@ $^ $(LDLIBS)
</code></pre>
<p>Everything you put into the <code>LDLIBS</code> environment variable gets passed to the
linker (<code>ld</code>) as a command line argument.</p>
<h3 id="secret-environment-variable-cppflags">secret environment variable: <code>CPPFLAGS</code></h3>
<p><code>Makefiles</code> sometimes define their own environment variables that they pass to
the compiler/linker, but <code>make</code> also has a bunch of &ldquo;implicit&rdquo; environment
variables which it will automatically pass to the C compiler and linker. There&rsquo;s a <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Implicit-Variables.html#index-CFLAGS0">full list of implicit environment variables here</a>,
but one of them is <code>CPPFLAGS</code>, which gets automatically passed to the C compiler.</p>
<p>(technically it would be more normal to use <code>CXXFLAGS</code> for this, but this
particular <code>Makefile</code> hardcodes <code>CXXFLAGS</code> so setting <code>CPPFLAGS</code> was the only
way I could find to set the compiler flags without editing the <code>Makefile</code>)</p>
<small>
As an aside: it took me a long time to realize how closely tied to C/C++ `make` is -- I used
to think that `make` was just a general build system (and of course you can use it for
anything!) but it has a lot of affordances for building C/C++ programs that it
doesn't have for building any other kind of program.
</small>
<h3 id="two-ways-to-pass-environment-variables-to-make">two ways to pass environment variables to <code>make</code></h3>
<p>I learned thanks to <a href="https://www.owlfolio.org/">@zwol</a> that there are actually two ways to pass environment variables to <code>make</code>:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>CXXFLAGS=xyz make</code> (the usual way)</li>
<li><code>make CXXFLAGS=xyz</code></li>
</ol>
<p>The difference between them is that <code>make CXXFLAGS=xyz</code> will override the
value of <code>CXXFLAGS</code> set in the <code>Makefile</code> but <code>CXXFLAGS=xyz make</code> won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure which way is the norm but I&rsquo;m going to use the first way in this
post.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-use-cppflags-and-ldlibs-to-fix-this-compiler-error">how to use <code>CPPFLAGS</code> and <code>LDLIBS</code> to fix this compiler error</h3>
<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve talked about how <code>CPPFLAGS</code> and <code>LDLIBS</code> get passed to the
compiler and linker, here&rsquo;s the final incantation that I used to get the
program to build successfully!</p>
<pre><code>CPPFLAGS=&quot;-I/opt/homebrew/include&quot; LDLIBS=&quot;-L/opt/homebrew/lib -liconv&quot; make paperjam
</code></pre>
<p>This passes <code>-I/opt/homebrew/include</code> to the compiler and <code>-L/opt/homebrew/lib -liconv</code> to the linker.</p>
<p>Also I don&rsquo;t want to pretend that I &ldquo;magically&rdquo; knew that those were the right
arguments to pass, figuring them out involved a bunch of confused Googling that I
skipped over in this post. I will say that:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <code>-I</code> compiler flag tells the compiler which directory to find header files in, like <code>/opt/homebrew/include/qpdf/QPDF.hh</code></li>
<li>the <code>-L</code> linker flag tells the linker which directory to find libraries in, like <code>/opt/homebrew/lib/libqpdf.a</code></li>
<li>the <code>-l</code> linker flag tells the linker which libraries to link in, like <code>-liconv</code> means &ldquo;link in the <code>iconv</code> library&rdquo;, or <code>-lm</code> means &ldquo;link <code>math</code>&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="tip-how-to-just-build-1-specific-file-make-filename">tip: how to just build 1 specific file: <code>make $FILENAME</code></h3>
<p>Yesterday I discovered this cool tool called
<a href="https://git.causal.agency/src/tree/bin/qf.c">qf</a> which you can use to quickly
open files from the output of <code>ripgrep</code>.</p>
<p><code>qf</code> is in a big directory of various tools, but I only wanted to compile <code>qf</code>.
So I just compiled <code>qf</code>, like this:</p>
<pre><code>make qf
</code></pre>
<p>Basically if you know (or can guess) the output filename of the file you&rsquo;re
trying to build, you can tell <code>make</code> to just build that file by running <code>make $FILENAME</code></p>
<h3 id="tip-you-don-t-need-a-makefile">tip: you don&rsquo;t need a Makefile</h3>
<p>I sometimes write 5-line C programs with no dependencies, and I just learned
that if I have a file called <code>blah.c</code>, I can just compile it like this without creating a <code>Makefile</code>:</p>
<pre><code>make blah
</code></pre>
<p>It gets automaticaly expanded to <code>cc -o blah blah.c</code>, which saves a bit of
typing. I have no idea if I&rsquo;m going to remember this (I might just keep typing
<code>gcc -o blah blah.c</code> anyway) but it seems like a fun trick.</p>
<h3 id="tip-look-at-how-other-packaging-systems-built-the-same-c-program">tip: look at how other packaging systems built the same C program</h3>
<p>If you&rsquo;re having trouble building a C program, maybe other people had problems building it
too! Every Linux distribution has build files for every package that they
build, so even if you can&rsquo;t install packages from that distribution directly,
maybe you can get tips from that Linux distro for how to build the package.
Realizing this (thanks to my friend Dave) was a huge ah-ha moment for me.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/405624e81a9b65378328accb0a11c3e5369e651c/pkgs/by-name/pa/paperjam/package.nix#L35">this line from the nix package for <code>paperjam</code></a> says:</p>
<pre><code>  env.NIX_LDFLAGS = lib.optionalString stdenv.hostPlatform.isDarwin &quot;-liconv&quot;;
</code></pre>
<p>This is basically saying &ldquo;pass the linker flag <code>-liconv</code> to build this on a
Mac&rdquo;, so that&rsquo;s a clue we could use to build it.</p>
<p>That same file also says <code>  env.NIX_CFLAGS_COMPILE = &quot;-DPOINTERHOLDER_TRANSITION=1&quot;;</code>. I&rsquo;m not sure what this means, but when I try
to build the <code>paperjam</code> package I do get an error about something called a
<code>PointerHolder</code>, so I guess that&rsquo;s somehow related to the &ldquo;PointerHolder
transition&rdquo;.</p>
<h3 id="step-5-installing-the-binary">step 5: installing the binary</h3>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve managed to compile the program, probably you want to install it somewhere!
Some <code>Makefile</code>s have an <code>install</code> target that let you install the tool on your
system with <code>make install</code>. I&rsquo;m always a bit scared of this (where is it going
to put the files? what if I want to uninstall them later?), so if I&rsquo;m compiling
a pretty simple program I&rsquo;ll often just manually copy the binary to install it
instead, like this:</p>
<pre><code>cp qf ~/bin
</code></pre>

<p>Once I figured out how to do all of this, I realized that I could use my new
<code>make</code> knowledge to contribute a <code>paperjam</code> package to Homebrew! Then I could
just <code>brew install paperjam</code> on future systems.</p>
<p>The good thing is that even if the details of how all of the different
packaging systems, they fundamentally all use C compilers and linkers.</p>
<h3 id="it-can-be-useful-to-understand-a-little-about-c-even-if-you-re-not-a-c-programmer">it can be useful to understand a little about C even if you&rsquo;re not a C programmer</h3>
<p>I think all of this is an interesting example of how it can useful to
understand some basics of how C programs work (like &ldquo;they have header files&rdquo;)
even if you&rsquo;re never planning to write a nontrivial C program if your life.</p>
<p>It feels good to have some ability to compile C/C++ programs myself, even
though I&rsquo;m still not totally confident about all of the compiler and linker
flags and I still plan to never learn anything about how autotools works other
than &ldquo;you run <code>./configure</code> to generate the <code>Makefile</code>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Two things I left out of this post:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH / DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> (which you use to tell the dynamic
linker at runtime where to find dynamically linked files) because I can&rsquo;t
remember the last time I ran into an <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> issue and couldn&rsquo;t
find an example.</li>
<li><code>pkg-config</code>, which I think is important but I don&rsquo;t understand yet</li>

### [Standards for ANSI escape codes](https://jvns.ca/blog/2025/03/07/escape-code-standards/)

**来源**: Julia Evans

**摘要**: <p>Hello! Today I want to talk about ANSI escape codes.</p>
<p>For a long time I was vaguely aware of ANSI escape codes (&ldquo;that&rsquo;s how you make
text red in the terminal and stuff&rdquo;) but I had no real understanding of where they were
supposed to be defined or whether or not there were standards for them. I just
had a kind of vague &ldquo;there be dragons&rdquo; feeling around them. While learning
about the terminal this year, I&rsquo;ve learned that:</p>
<ol>
<li>ANSI escape codes are responsible for a lot of usability improvements
in the terminal (did you know there&rsquo;s a way to copy to your system clipboard
when SSHed into a remote machine?? It&rsquo;s an escape code called <a href="https://jvns.ca/til/vim-osc52/">OSC 52</a>!)</li>
<li>They aren&rsquo;t completely standardized, and because of that they don&rsquo;t always
work reliably. And because they&rsquo;re also invisible, it&rsquo;s extremely
frustrating to troubleshoot escape code issues.</li>
</ol>
<p>So I wanted to put together a list for myself of some standards that exist
around escape codes, because I want to know if they <em>have</em> to feel unreliable
and frustrating, or if there&rsquo;s a future where we could all rely on them with
more confidence.</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="what-s-an-escape-code">what&rsquo;s an escape code?</h3>
<p>Have you ever pressed the left arrow key in your terminal and seen <code>^[[D</code>?
That&rsquo;s an escape code! It&rsquo;s called an &ldquo;escape code&rdquo; because the first character
is the &ldquo;escape&rdquo; character, which is usually written as <code>ESC</code>, <code>\x1b</code>, <code>\E</code>,
<code>\033</code>, or <code>^[</code>.</p>
<p>Escape codes are how your terminal emulator communicates various kinds of
information (colours, mouse movement, etc) with programs running in the
terminal. There are two kind of escape codes:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>input codes</strong> which your terminal emulator sends for keypresses or mouse
movements that don&rsquo;t fit into Unicode. For example &ldquo;left arrow key&rdquo; is
<code>ESC[D</code>, &ldquo;Ctrl+left arrow&rdquo; might be <code>ESC[1;5D</code>, and clicking the mouse might
be something like <code>ESC[M :3</code>.</li>
<li><strong>output codes</strong> which programs can print out to colour text, move the
cursor around, clear the screen, hide the cursor, copy text to the
clipboard, enable mouse reporting, set the window title, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s talk about standards!</p>
<h3 id="ecma-48">ECMA-48</h3>
<p>The first standard I found relating to escape codes was
<a href="https://ecma-international.org/wp-content/uploads/ECMA-48_5th_edition_june_1991.pdf">ECMA-48</a>,
which was originally published in 1976.</p>
<p>ECMA-48 does two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Define some general <em>formats</em> for escape codes (like &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; codes, which are
<code>ESC[</code> + something and &ldquo;OSC&rdquo; codes, which are <code>ESC]</code> + something)</li>
<li>Define some specific escape codes, like how &ldquo;move the cursor to the left&rdquo; is
<code>ESC[D</code>, or &ldquo;turn text red&rdquo; is  <code>ESC[31m</code>. In the spec, the &ldquo;cursor left&rdquo;
one is called <code>CURSOR LEFT</code> and the one for changing colours is called
<code>SELECT GRAPHIC RENDITION</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The formats are extensible, so there&rsquo;s room for others to define more escape
codes in the future. Lots of escape codes that are popular today aren&rsquo;t defined
in ECMA-48: for example it&rsquo;s pretty common for terminal applications (like vim,
htop, or tmux) to support using the mouse, but ECMA-48 doesn&rsquo;t define escape
codes for the mouse.</p>
<h3 id="xterm-control-sequences">xterm control sequences</h3>
<p>There are a bunch of escape codes that aren&rsquo;t defined in ECMA-48, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>enabling mouse reporting (where did you click in your terminal?)</li>
<li>bracketed paste (did you paste that text or type it in?)</li>
<li>OSC 52 (which terminal applications can use to copy text to your system clipboard)</li>
</ul>
<p>I believe (correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong!) that these and some others came from
xterm, are documented in <a href="https://invisible-island.net/xterm/ctlseqs/ctlseqs.html">XTerm Control Sequences</a>, and have
been widely implemented by other terminal emulators.</p>
<p>This list of &ldquo;what xterm supports&rdquo; is not a standard exactly, but xterm is
extremely influential and so it seems like an important document.</p>
<h3 id="terminfo">terminfo</h3>
<p>In the 80s (and to some extent today, but my understanding is that it was MUCH
more dramatic in the 80s) there was a huge amount of variation in what escape
codes terminals actually supported.</p>
<p>To deal with this, there&rsquo;s a database of escape codes for various terminals
called &ldquo;terminfo&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It looks like the standard for terminfo is called <a href="https://publications.opengroup.org/c243-1">X/Open Curses</a>, though you need to create
an account to view that standard for some reason. It defines the database format as well
as a C library interface (&ldquo;curses&rdquo;) for accessing the database.</p>
<p>For example you can run this bash snippet to see every possible escape code for
&ldquo;clear screen&rdquo; for all of the different terminals your system knows about:</p>
<pre><code>for term in $(toe -a | awk '{print $1}')
do
  echo $term
  infocmp -1 -T &quot;$term&quot; 2&gt;/dev/null | grep 'clear=' | sed 's/clear=//g;s/,//g'
done
</code></pre>
<p>On my system (and probably every system I&rsquo;ve ever used?), the terminfo database is managed by ncurses.</p>
<h3 id="should-programs-use-terminfo">should programs use terminfo?</h3>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s interesting that there are two main approaches that applications
take to handling ANSI escape codes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use the terminfo database to figure out which escape codes to use, depending
on what&rsquo;s in the <code>TERM</code> environment variable. Fish does this, for example.</li>
<li>Identify a &ldquo;single common set&rdquo; of escape codes which works in &ldquo;enough&rdquo;
terminal emulators and just hardcode those.</li>
</ol>
<p>Some examples of programs/libraries that take approach #2 (&ldquo;don&rsquo;t use terminfo&rdquo;) include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/commit/c12699d2e9c2806d6ed184032078d0b84a3370bb">kakoune</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit/blob/165258d2f3ae594b50f16c7b50ffb06627476269/src/prompt_toolkit/input/ansi_escape_sequences.py#L5-L8">python-prompt-toolkit</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/antirez/linenoise">linenoise</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rockorager/libvaxis">libvaxis</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/chalk/chalk">chalk</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I got curious about why folks might be moving away from terminfo and I found
this very interesting and extremely detailed
<a href="https://twoot.site/@bean/113056942625234032">rant about terminfo from one of the fish maintainers</a>, which argues that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[the terminfo authors] have done a lot of work that, at the time, was
extremely important and helpful. My point is that it no longer is.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to do it justice so I&rsquo;m not going to summarize it, I think it&rsquo;s
worth reading.</p>
<h3 id="is-there-a-single-common-set-of-escape-codes">is there a &ldquo;single common set&rdquo; of escape codes?</h3>
<p>I was just talking about the idea that you can use a &ldquo;common set&rdquo; of escape
codes that will work for most people. But what is that set? Is there any agreement?</p>
<p>I really do not know the answer to this at all, but from doing some reading it
seems like it&rsquo;s some combination of:</p>
<ul>
<li>The codes that the VT100 supported (though some aren&rsquo;t relevant on modern terminals)</li>
<li>what&rsquo;s in ECMA-48 (which I think also has some things that are no longer relevant)</li>
<li>What xterm supports (though I&rsquo;d guess that not everything in there is actually widely supported enough)</li>
</ul>
<p>and maybe ultimately &ldquo;identify the terminal emulators you think your users are
going to use most frequently and test in those&rdquo;, the same way web developers do
when deciding which CSS features are okay to use</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there are any resources like <a href="https://caniuse.com/">Can I use&hellip;?</a> or
<a href="https://web-platform-dx.github.io/web-features/">Baseline</a> for the terminal
though. (in theory terminfo is supposed to be the &ldquo;caniuse&rdquo; for the terminal
but it seems like it often takes 10+ years to add new terminal features when
people invent them which makes it very limited)</p>
<h3 id="some-reasons-to-use-terminfo">some reasons to use terminfo</h3>
<p>I also asked on Mastodon why people found terminfo valuable in 2025 and got a
few reasons that made sense to me:</p>
<ul>
<li>some people expect to be able to use the <code>TERM</code> environment variable to
control how programs behave (for example with <code>TERM=dumb</code>), and there&rsquo;s
no standard for how that should work in a post-terminfo world</li>
<li>even though there&rsquo;s <em>less</em> variation between terminal emulators than
there was in the 80s, there&rsquo;s far from zero variation: there are graphical
terminals, the Linux framebuffer console, the situation you&rsquo;re in when
connecting to a server via its serial console, Emacs shell mode, and probably
more that I&rsquo;m missing</li>
<li>there is no one standard for what the &ldquo;single common set&rdquo; of escape codes
is, and sometimes programs use escape codes which aren&rsquo;t actually widely
supported enough</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="terminfo-user-agent-detection">terminfo &amp; user agent detection</h3>
<p>The way that ncurses uses the <code>TERM</code> environment variable to decide which
escape codes to use reminds me of how webservers used to sometimes use the
browser user agent to decide which version of a website to serve.</p>
<p>It also seems like it&rsquo;s had some of the same results &ndash; the way iTerm2 reports
itself as being &ldquo;xterm-256color&rdquo; feels similar to how Safari&rsquo;s user agent is
&ldquo;Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 14_7_4) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML,
like Gecko) Version/18.3 Safari/605.1.15&rdquo;. In both cases the terminal emulator
/ browser ends up changing its user agent to get around user agent detection
that isn&rsquo;t working well.</p>
<p>On the web we ended up deciding that user agent detection was not a good
practice and to instead focus on standardization so we can serve the same
HTML/CSS to all browsers. I don&rsquo;t know if the same approach is the future in
the terminal though &ndash; I think the terminal landscape today is much more
fragmented than the web ever was as well as being much less well funded.</p>
<h3 id="some-more-documents-standards">some more documents/standards</h3>
<p>A few more documents and standards related to escape codes, in no particular order:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man4/console_codes.4.html">Linux console_codes man page</a> documents
escape codes that Linux supports</li>
<li>how the <a href="https://vt100.net/docs/vt100-ug/chapter3.html">VT 100</a> handles escape codes &amp; control sequences</li>
<li>the <a href="https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/keyboard-protocol/">kitty keyboard protocol</a></li>
<li><a href="https://gist.github.com/egmontkob/eb114294efbcd5adb1944c9f3cb5feda">OSC 8</a> for links in the terminal (and notes on <a href="https://github.com/Alhadis/OSC8-Adoption?tab=readme-ov-file">adoption</a>)</li>
<li>A <a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux/blob/882fb4d295deb3e4b803eb444915763305114e4f/tools/ansicode.txt">summary of ANSI standards from tmux</a></li>
<li>this <a href="https://iterm2.com/feature-reporting/">terminal features reporting specification from iTerm</a></li>
<li>sixel graphics</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-i-think-this-is-interesting">why I think this is interesting</h3>
<p>I sometimes see people saying that the unix terminal is &ldquo;outdated&rdquo;, and since I
love the terminal so much I&rsquo;m always curious about what incremental changes
might make it feel less &ldquo;outdated&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Maybe if we had a clearer standards landscape (like we do on the web!) it would
be easier for terminal emulator developers to build new features and for
authors of terminal applications to more confidently adopt those features so
that we can all benefit from them and have a richer experience in the terminal.</p>
<p>Obviously standardizing ANSI escape codes is not easy (ECMA-48 was first
published almost 50 years ago and we&rsquo;re still not there!). I don&rsquo;t even know
what all of the challenges are. But the situation with HTML/CSS/JS used to be
extremely bad too and now it&rsquo;s MUCH better, so maybe there&rsquo;s hope.</p>

### [How to add a directory to your PATH](https://jvns.ca/blog/2025/02/13/how-to-add-a-directory-to-your-path/)

**来源**: Julia Evans

**摘要**: <p>I was talking to a friend about how to add a directory to your PATH today. It&rsquo;s
something that feels &ldquo;obvious&rdquo; to me since I&rsquo;ve been using the terminal for a
long time, but when I searched for instructions for how to do it, I actually
couldn&rsquo;t find something that explained all of the steps &ndash; a lot of them just
said &ldquo;add this to <code>~/.bashrc</code>&rdquo;, but what if you&rsquo;re not using bash? What if your
bash config is actually in a different file? And how are you supposed to figure
out which directory to add anyway?</p>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-1-what-shell-are-you-using">step 1: what shell are you using?</h3>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not sure what shell you&rsquo;re using, here&rsquo;s a way to find out. Run this:</p>
<pre><code>ps -p $$ -o pid,comm=
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>if you&rsquo;re using <strong>bash</strong>, it&rsquo;ll print out <code>97295 bash</code></li>
<li>if you&rsquo;re using <strong>zsh</strong>, it&rsquo;ll print out <code>97295 zsh</code></li>
<li>if you&rsquo;re using <strong>fish</strong>, it&rsquo;ll print out an error like &ldquo;In fish, please use
$fish_pid&rdquo; (<code>$$</code> isn&rsquo;t valid syntax in fish, but in any case the error
message tells you that you&rsquo;re using fish, which you probably already knew)</li>
</ul>
<p>Also bash is the default on Linux and zsh is the default on Mac OS (as of
2024). I&rsquo;ll only cover bash, zsh, and fish in these directions.</p>
<h3 id="step-2-find-your-shell-s-config-file">step 2: find your shell&rsquo;s config file</h3>
<ul>
<li>in zsh, it&rsquo;s probably <code>~/.zshrc</code></li>
<li>in bash, it might be <code>~/.bashrc</code>, but it&rsquo;s complicated, see the note in the next section</li>
<li>in fish, it&rsquo;s probably <code>~/.config/fish/config.fish</code> (you can run <code>echo $__fish_config_dir</code> if you want to be 100% sure)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="a-note-on-bash-s-config-file">a note on bash&rsquo;s config file</h3>
<p>Bash has three possible config files: <code>~/.bashrc</code>, <code>~/.bash_profile</code>, and <code>~/.profile</code>.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not sure which one your system is set up to use, I&rsquo;d recommend
testing this way:</p>
<ol>
<li>add <code>echo hi there</code> to your <code>~/.bashrc</code></li>
<li>Restart your terminal</li>
<li>If you see &ldquo;hi there&rdquo;, that means <code>~/.bashrc</code> is being used! Hooray!</li>
<li>Otherwise remove it and try the same thing with <code>~/.bash_profile</code></li>
<li>You can also try <code>~/.profile</code> if the first two options don&rsquo;t work.</li>
</ol>
<p>(there are a lot of <a href="https://blog.flowblok.id.au/2013-02/shell-startup-scripts.html">elaborate flow charts</a> out there that explain how bash
decides which config file to use but IMO it&rsquo;s not worth it to internalize them
and just testing is the fastest way to be sure)</p>
<h3 id="step-3-figure-out-which-directory-to-add">step 3: figure out which directory to add</h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say that you&rsquo;re trying to install and run a program called <code>http-server</code>
and it doesn&rsquo;t work, like this:</p>
<pre><code>$ npm install -g http-server
$ http-server
bash: http-server: command not found
</code></pre>
<p>How do you find what directory <code>http-server</code> is in? Honestly in general this is
not that easy &ndash; often the answer is something like &ldquo;it depends on how npm is
configured&rdquo;. A few ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Often when setting up a new installer (like <code>cargo</code>, <code>npm</code>, <code>homebrew</code>, etc),
when you first set it up it&rsquo;ll print out some directions about how to update
your PATH. So if you&rsquo;re paying attention you can get the directions then.</li>
<li>Sometimes installers will automatically update your shell&rsquo;s config file
to update your <code>PATH</code> for you</li>
<li>Sometimes just Googling &ldquo;where does npm install things?&rdquo; will turn up the
answer</li>
<li>Some tools have a subcommand that tells you where they&rsquo;re configured to
install things, like:
<ul>
<li>Node/npm: <code>npm config get prefix</code> (then append <code>/bin/</code>)</li>
<li>Go: <code>go env GOPATH</code> (then append <code>/bin/</code>)</li>
<li>asdf: <code>asdf info | grep ASDF_DIR</code> (then append <code>/bin/</code> and <code>/shims/</code>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-3-1-double-check-it-s-the-right-directory">step 3.1: double check it&rsquo;s the right directory</h3>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve found a directory you think might be the right one, make sure it&rsquo;s
actually correct! For example, I found out that on my machine, <code>http-server</code> is
in <code>~/.npm-global/bin</code>. I can make sure that it&rsquo;s the right directory by trying to
run the program <code>http-server</code> in that directory like this:</p>
<pre><code>$ ~/.npm-global/bin/http-server
Starting up http-server, serving ./public
</code></pre>
<p>It worked! Now that you know what directory you need to add to your <code>PATH</code>,
let&rsquo;s move to the next step!</p>
<h3 id="step-4-edit-your-shell-config">step 4: edit your shell config</h3>
<p>Now we have the 2 critical pieces of information we need:</p>
<ol>
<li>Which directory you&rsquo;re trying to add to your PATH (like  <code>~/.npm-global/bin/</code>)</li>
<li>Where your shell&rsquo;s config is (like <code>~/.bashrc</code>, <code>~/.zshrc</code>, or <code>~/.config/fish/config.fish</code>)</li>
</ol>
<p>Now what you need to add depends on your shell:</p>
<p><strong>bash instructions:</strong></p>
<p>Open your shell&rsquo;s config file, and add a line like this:</p>
<pre><code>export PATH=$PATH:~/.npm-global/bin/
</code></pre>
<p>(obviously replace <code>~/.npm-global/bin</code> with the actual directory you&rsquo;re trying to add)</p>
<p><strong>zsh instructions:</strong></p>
<p>You can do the same thing as in bash, but zsh also has some slightly fancier
syntax you can use if you prefer:</p>
<pre><code>path=(
  $path
  ~/.npm-global/bin
)
</code></pre>
<p><strong>fish instructions:</strong></p>
<p>In fish, the syntax is different:</p>
<pre><code>set PATH $PATH ~/.npm-global/bin
</code></pre>
<p>(in fish you can also use <code>fish_add_path</code>, some notes on that <a href="https://jvns.ca/atom.xml#a-note-on-fish-add-path">further down</a>)</p>
<h3 id="step-5-restart-your-shell">step 5: restart your shell</h3>
<p>Now, an extremely important step: updating your shell&rsquo;s config won&rsquo;t take
effect if you don&rsquo;t restart it!</p>
<p>Two ways to do this:</p>
<ol>
<li>open a new terminal (or terminal tab), and maybe close the old one so you don&rsquo;t get confused</li>
<li>Run <code>bash</code> to start a new shell (or <code>zsh</code> if you&rsquo;re using zsh, or <code>fish</code> if you&rsquo;re using fish)</li>
</ol>
<p>I&rsquo;ve found that both of these usually work fine.</p>
<p>And you should be done! Try running the program you were trying to run and
hopefully it works now.</p>
<p>If not, here are a couple of problems that you might run into:</p>
<h3 id="problem-1-it-ran-the-wrong-program">problem 1: it ran the wrong program</h3>
<p>If the wrong <strong>version</strong> of a program is running, you might need to add the
directory to the <em>beginning</em> of your PATH instead of the end.</p>
<p>For example, on my system I have two versions of <code>python3</code> installed, which I
can see by running <code>which -a</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ which -a python3
/usr/bin/python3
/opt/homebrew/bin/python3
</code></pre>
<p>The one your shell will use is the <strong>first one listed</strong>.</p>
<p>If you want to use the Homebrew version, you need to add that directory
(<code>/opt/homebrew/bin</code>) to the <strong>beginning</strong> of your PATH instead, by putting this in
your shell&rsquo;s config file (it&rsquo;s <code>/opt/homebrew/bin/:$PATH</code> instead of the usual <code>$PATH:/opt/homebrew/bin/</code>)</p>
<pre><code>export PATH=/opt/homebrew/bin/:$PATH
</code></pre>
<p>or in fish:</p>
<pre><code>set PATH ~/.cargo/bin $PATH
</code></pre>
<h3 id="problem-2-the-program-isn-t-being-run-from-your-shell">problem 2: the program isn&rsquo;t being run from your shell</h3>
<p>All of these directions only work if you&rsquo;re running the program <strong>from your
shell</strong>. If you&rsquo;re running the program from an IDE, from a GUI, in a cron job,
or some other way, you&rsquo;ll need to add the directory to your PATH in a different
way, and the exact details might depend on the situation.</p>
<p><strong>in a cron job</strong></p>
<p>Some options:</p>
<ul>
<li>use the full path to the program you&rsquo;re running, like <code>/home/bork/bin/my-program</code></li>
<li>put the full PATH you want as the first line of your crontab (something like
PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:&hellip;.). You can get the full PATH you&rsquo;re
using in your shell by running <code>echo &quot;PATH=$PATH&quot;</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m honestly not sure how to handle it in an IDE/GUI because I haven&rsquo;t run into
that in a long time, will add directions here if someone points me in the right
direction.</p>
<h3 id="problem-3-duplicate-path-entries-making-it-harder-to-debug">problem 3: duplicate <code>PATH</code> entries making it harder to debug</h3>
<p>If you edit your path and start a new shell by running <code>bash</code> (or <code>zsh</code>, or
<code>fish</code>), you&rsquo;ll often end up with duplicate <code>PATH</code> entries, because the shell
keeps adding new things to your <code>PATH</code> every time you start your shell.</p>
<p>Personally I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve run into a situation where this kind of
duplication breaks anything, but the duplicates can make it harder to debug
what&rsquo;s going on with your <code>PATH</code> if you&rsquo;re trying to understand its contents.</p>
<p>Some ways you could deal with this:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you&rsquo;re debugging your <code>PATH</code>, open a new terminal to do it in so you get
a &ldquo;fresh&rdquo; state. This should avoid the duplication.</li>
<li>Deduplicate your <code>PATH</code> at the end of your shell&rsquo;s config  (for example in
zsh apparently you can do this with <code>typeset -U path</code>)</li>
<li>Check that the directory isn&rsquo;t already in your <code>PATH</code> when adding it (for
example in fish I believe you can do this with <code>fish_add_path --path /some/directory</code>)</li>
</ol>
<p>How to deduplicate your <code>PATH</code> is shell-specific and there isn&rsquo;t always a
built in way to do it so you&rsquo;ll need to look up how to accomplish it in your
shell.</p>
<h3 id="problem-4-losing-your-history-after-updating-your-path">problem 4: losing your history after updating your <code>PATH</code></h3>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a situation that&rsquo;s easy to get into in bash or zsh:</p>
<ol>
<li>Run a command (it fails)</li>
<li>Update your <code>PATH</code></li>
<li>Run <code>bash</code> to reload your config</li>
<li>Press the up arrow a couple of times to rerun the failed command (or open a new terminal)</li>
<li>The failed command isn&rsquo;t in your history! Why not?</li>
</ol>
<p>This happens because in bash, by default, history is not saved until you exit
the shell.</p>
<p>Some options for fixing this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of running <code>bash</code> to reload your config, run <code>source ~/.bashrc</code> (or
<code>source ~/.zshrc</code> in zsh). This will reload the config inside your current
session.</li>
<li>Configure your shell to continuously save your history instead of only saving
the history when the shell exits. (How to do this depends on whether you&rsquo;re
using bash or zsh, the history options in zsh are a bit complicated and I&rsquo;m
not exactly sure what the best way is)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="a-note-on-source">a note on <code>source</code></h3>
<p>When you install <code>cargo</code> (Rust&rsquo;s installer) for the first time, it gives you
these instructions for how to set up your PATH, which don&rsquo;t mention a specific
directory at all.</p>
<pre><code>This is usually done by running one of the following (note the leading DOT):

. &quot;$HOME/.cargo/env&quot;        	# For sh/bash/zsh/ash/dash/pdksh
source &quot;$HOME/.cargo/env.fish&quot;  # For fish
</code></pre>
<p>The idea is that you add that line to your shell&rsquo;s config, and their script
automatically sets up your <code>PATH</code> (and potentially other things) for you.</p>
<p>This is pretty common (for example <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/install/blob/deacfa6a6e62e5f4002baf9e1fac7a96e9aa5d41/install.sh#L1072-L1087">Homebrew</a> suggests you eval <code>brew shellenv</code>), and there are
two ways to approach this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Just do what the tool suggests (like adding <code>. &quot;$HOME/.cargo/env&quot;</code> to your shell&rsquo;s config)</li>
<li>Figure out which directories the script they&rsquo;re telling you to run would add
to your PATH, and then add those manually. Here&rsquo;s how I&rsquo;d do that:
<ul>
<li>Run <code>. &quot;$HOME/.cargo/env&quot;</code> in my shell (or the fish version if using fish)</li>
<li>Run <code>echo &quot;$PATH&quot; | tr ':' '\n' | grep cargo</code> to figure out which directories it added</li>
<li>See that it says <code>/Users/bork/.cargo/bin</code> and shorten that to <code>~/.cargo/bin</code></li>
<li>Add the directory <code>~/.cargo/bin</code> to PATH (with the directions in this post)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s anything wrong with doing what the tool suggests (it
might be the &ldquo;best way&rdquo;!), but personally I usually use the second approach
because I prefer knowing exactly what configuration I&rsquo;m changing.</p>
<h3 id="a-note-on-fish-add-path">a note on <code>fish_add_path</code></h3>
<p>fish has a handy function called <code>fish_add_path</code> that you can run to add a directory to your <code>PATH</code> like this:</p>
<pre><code>fish_add_path /some/directory
</code></pre>
<p>This is cool (it&rsquo;s such a simple command!) but I&rsquo;ve stopped using it for a couple of reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sometimes <code>fish_add_path</code> will update the <code>PATH</code> for every session in the
future (with a &ldquo;universal variable&rdquo;) and sometimes it will update the <code>PATH</code>
just for the current session and it&rsquo;s hard for me to tell which one it will
do. In theory the docs explain this but I could not understand them.</li>
<li>If you ever need to <em>remove</em> the directory from your <code>PATH</code> a few weeks or
months later because maybe you made a mistake, it&rsquo;s kind of hard to do
(there are <a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8604">instructions in this comments of this github issue though</a>).</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="that-s-all">that&rsquo;s all</h3>
<p>Hopefully this will help some people. Let me know (on Mastodon or Bluesky) if
you there are other major gotchas that have tripped you up when adding a
directory to your PATH, or if you have questions about this post!</p>

### [Some terminal frustrations](https://jvns.ca/blog/2025/02/05/some-terminal-frustrations/)

**来源**: Julia Evans

**摘要**: <p>A few weeks ago I ran a terminal survey (you can <a href="https://jvns.ca/terminal-survey/results-bsky.html">read the results here</a>) and at the end I asked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What’s the most frustrating thing about using the terminal for you?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>1600 people answered, and I decided to spend a few days categorizing all the
responses. Along the way I learned that classifying qualitative data is not
easy but I gave it my best shot. I ended up building a custom
<a href="https://github.com/jvns/classificator">tool</a> to make it faster to categorize
everything.</p>
<p>As with all of my surveys the methodology isn&rsquo;t particularly scientific. I just
posted the survey to Mastodon and Twitter, ran it for a couple of days, and got
answers from whoever happened to see it and felt like responding.</p>
<p>Here are the top categories of frustrations!</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s worth keeping in mind while reading these comments that</p>
<ul>
<li>40% of people answering this survey have been using the terminal for <strong>21+ years</strong></li>
<li>95% of people answering the survey have been using the terminal for at least 4 years</li>
</ul>
<p>These comments aren&rsquo;t coming from total beginners.</p>
<p>Here are the categories of frustrations! The number in brackets is the number
of people with that frustration. I&rsquo;m mostly writing this up for myself because
I&rsquo;m trying to write a zine about the terminal and I wanted to get a sense for
what people are having trouble with.</p>
<h3 id="remembering-syntax-115">remembering syntax (115)</h3>
<p>People talked about struggles remembering:</p>
<ul>
<li>the syntax for CLI tools like awk, jq, sed, etc</li>
<li>the syntax for redirects</li>
<li>keyboard shortcuts for tmux, text editing, etc</li>
</ul>
<p>One example comment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are just so many little &ldquo;trivia&rdquo; details to remember for full
functionality. Even after all these years I&rsquo;ll sometimes forget where it&rsquo;s 2
or 1 for stderr, or forget which is which for <code>&gt;</code> and <code>&gt;&gt;</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="switching-terminals-is-hard-91">switching terminals is hard (91)</h3>
<p>People talked about struggling with switching systems (for example home/work
computer or when SSHing) and running into:</p>
<ul>
<li>OS differences in keyboard shortcuts (like Linux vs Mac)</li>
<li>systems which don&rsquo;t have their preferred text editor (&ldquo;no vim&rdquo; or &ldquo;only vim&rdquo;)</li>
<li>different versions of the same command (like Mac OS grep vs GNU grep)</li>
<li>no tab completion</li>
<li>a shell they aren&rsquo;t used to (&ldquo;the subtle differences between zsh and bash&rdquo;)</li>
</ul>
<p>as well as differences inside the same system like pagers being not consistent
with each other (git diff pagers, other pagers).</p>
<p>One example comment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I got used to fish and vi mode which are not available when I ssh into
servers, containers.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="color-85">color (85)</h3>
<p>Lots of problems with color, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>programs setting colors that are unreadable with a light background color</li>
<li>finding a colorscheme they like (and getting it to work consistently across different apps)</li>
<li>color not working inside several layers of SSH/tmux/etc</li>
<li>not liking the defaults</li>
<li>not wanting color at all and struggling to turn it off</li>
</ul>
<p>This comment felt relatable to me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Getting my terminal theme configured in a reasonable way between the terminal
emulator and fish (I did this years ago and remember it being tedious and
fiddly and now feel like I&rsquo;m locked into my current theme because it works
and I dread touching any of that configuration ever again).</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="keyboard-shortcuts-84">keyboard shortcuts (84)</h3>
<p>Half of the comments on keyboard shortcuts were about how on Linux/Windows, the
keyboard shortcut to copy/paste in the terminal is different from in the rest
of the OS.</p>
<p>Some other issues with keyboard shortcuts other than copy/paste:</p>
<ul>
<li>using <code>Ctrl-W</code> in a browser-based terminal and closing the window</li>
<li>the terminal only supports a limited set of keyboard shortcuts (no
<code>Ctrl-Shift-</code>, no <code>Super</code>, no <code>Hyper</code>, lots of <code>ctrl-</code> shortcuts aren&rsquo;t
possible like <code>Ctrl-,</code>)</li>
<li>the OS stopping you from using a terminal keyboard shortcut (like by default
Mac OS uses <code>Ctrl+left arrow</code> for something else)</li>
<li>issues using emacs in the terminal</li>
<li>backspace not working (2)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="other-copy-and-paste-issues-75">other copy and paste issues (75)</h3>
<p>Aside from &ldquo;the keyboard shortcut for copy and paste is different&rdquo;, there were
a lot of OTHER issues with copy and paste, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>copying over SSH</li>
<li>how tmux and the terminal emulator both do copy/paste in different ways</li>
<li>dealing with many different clipboards (system clipboard, vim clipboard, the
&ldquo;middle click&rdquo; clipboard on Linux, tmux&rsquo;s clipboard, etc) and potentially
synchronizing them</li>
<li>random spaces added when copying from the terminal</li>
<li>pasting multiline commands which automatically get run in a terrifying way</li>
<li>wanting a way to copy text without using the mouse</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="discoverability-55">discoverability (55)</h3>
<p>There were lots of comments about this, which all came down to the same basic
complaint &ndash; it&rsquo;s hard to discover useful tools or features! This comment kind of
summed it all up:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How difficult it is to learn independently. Most of what I know is an
assorted collection of stuff I&rsquo;ve been told by random people over the years.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="steep-learning-curve-44">steep learning curve (44)</h3>
<p>A lot of comments about it generally having a steep learning curve. A couple of
example comments:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After 15 years of using it, I’m not much faster than using it than I was 5 or
maybe even 10 years ago.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That I know I could make my life easier by learning more about the shortcuts
and commands and configuring the terminal but I don&rsquo;t spend the time because it
feels overwhelming.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="history-42">history  (42)</h3>
<p>Some issues with shell history:</p>
<ul>
<li>history not being shared between terminal tabs (16)</li>
<li>limits that are too short (4)</li>
<li>history not being restored when terminal tabs are restored</li>
<li>losing history because the terminal crashed</li>
<li>not knowing how to search history</li>
</ul>
<p>One example comment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It wasted a lot of time until I figured it out and still annoys me that
&ldquo;history&rdquo; on zsh has such a small buffer;  I have to type &ldquo;history 0&rdquo; to get
any useful length of history.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="bad-documentation-37">bad documentation (37)</h3>
<p>People talked about:</p>
<ul>
<li>documentation being generally opaque</li>
<li>lack of examples in man pages</li>
<li>programs which don&rsquo;t have man pages</li>
</ul>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a representative comment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Finding good examples and docs. Man pages often not enough, have to wade
through stack overflow</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="scrollback-36">scrollback (36)</h3>
<p>A few issues with scrollback:</p>
<ul>
<li>programs printing out too much data making you lose scrollback history</li>
<li>resizing the terminal messes up the scrollback</li>
<li>lack of timestamps</li>
<li>GUI programs that you start in the background printing stuff out that gets in
the way of other programs&rsquo; outputs</li>
</ul>
<p>One example comment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When resizing the terminal (in particular: making it narrower) leads to
broken rewrapping of the scrollback content because the commands formatted
their output based on the terminal window width.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="it-feels-outdated-33">&ldquo;it feels outdated&rdquo; (33)</h3>
<p>Lots of comments about how the terminal feels hampered by legacy decisions and
how users often end up needing to learn implementation details that feel very
esoteric. One example comment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most of the legacy cruft, it would be great to have a green field
implementation of the CLI interface.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="shell-scripting-32">shell scripting (32)</h3>
<p>Lots of complaints about POSIX shell scripting. There&rsquo;s a general feeling that
shell scripting is difficult but also that switching to a different less
standard scripting language (fish, nushell, etc) brings its own problems.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shell scripting. My tolerance to ditch a shell script and go to a scripting
language is pretty low. It’s just too messy and powerful. Screwing up can be
costly so I don’t even bother.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="more-issues">more issues</h3>
<p>Some more issues that were mentioned at least 10 times:</p>
<ul>
<li>(31) inconsistent command line arguments: is it -h or help or &ndash;help?</li>
<li>(24) keeping dotfiles in sync across different systems</li>
<li>(23) performance (e.g. &ldquo;my shell takes too long to start&rdquo;)</li>
<li>(20) window management (potentially with some combination of tmux tabs, terminal tabs, and multiple terminal windows. Where did that shell session go?)</li>
<li>(17) generally feeling scared/uneasy (&ldquo;The debilitating fear that I’m going
to do some mysterious Bad Thing with a command and I will have absolutely no
idea how to fix or undo it or even really figure out what happened&rdquo;)</li>
<li>(16) terminfo issues (&ldquo;Having to learn about terminfo if/when I try a new terminal emulator and ssh elsewhere.&rdquo;)</li>
<li>(16) lack of image support (sixel etc)</li>
<li>(15) SSH issues (like having to start over when you lose the SSH connection)</li>
<li>(15) various tmux/screen issues (for example lack of integration between tmux and the terminal emulator)</li>
<li>(15) typos &amp; slow typing</li>
<li>(13) the terminal getting messed up for various reasons (pressing <code>Ctrl-S</code>, <code>cat</code>ing a binary, etc)</li>
<li>(12) quoting/escaping in the shell</li>
<li>(11) various Windows/PowerShell issues</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="n-a-122">n/a (122)</h3>
<p>There were also 122 answers to the effect of &ldquo;nothing really&rdquo; or &ldquo;only that I
can&rsquo;t do EVERYTHING in the terminal&rdquo;</p>
<p>One example comment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Think I&rsquo;ve found work arounds for most/all frustrations</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="that-s-all">that&rsquo;s all!</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to make a lot of commentary on these results, but here are a
couple of categories that feel related to me:</p>
<ul>
<li>remembering syntax &amp; history (often the thing you need to remember is something you&rsquo;ve run before!)</li>
<li>discoverability &amp; the learning curve (the lack of discoverability is definitely a big part of what makes it hard to learn)</li>
<li>&ldquo;switching systems is hard&rdquo; &amp; &ldquo;it feels outdated&rdquo; (tools that haven&rsquo;t really
changed in 30 or 40 years have many problems but they do tend to be always
<em>there</em> no matter what system you&rsquo;re on, which is very useful and makes them
hard to stop using)</li>
</ul>
<p>Trying to categorize all these results in a reasonable way really gave me an
appreciation for social science researchers&rsquo; skills.</p>

### [What's involved in getting a "modern" terminal setup?](https://jvns.ca/blog/2025/01/11/getting-a-modern-terminal-setup/)

**来源**: Julia Evans

**摘要**: <p>Hello! Recently I ran a terminal survey and I asked people what frustrated
them. One person commented:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are so many pieces to having a modern terminal experience. I wish it
all came out of the box.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My immediate reaction was &ldquo;oh, getting a modern terminal experience isn&rsquo;t that
hard, you just need to&hellip;.&rdquo;, but the more I thought about it, the longer the
&ldquo;you just need to&hellip;&rdquo; list got, and I kept thinking about more and more
caveats.</p>
<p>So I thought I would write down some notes about what it means to me personally
to have a &ldquo;modern&rdquo; terminal experience and what I think can make it hard for
people to get there.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-a-modern-terminal-experience">what is a &ldquo;modern terminal experience&rdquo;?</h3>
<p>Here are a few things that are important to me, with which part of the system
is responsible for them:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>multiline support for copy and paste</strong>: if you paste 3 commands in your shell, it should not immediately run them all! That&rsquo;s scary! (<strong>shell</strong>, <strong>terminal emulator</strong>)</li>
<li><strong>infinite shell history</strong>: if I run a command in my shell, it should be saved forever, not deleted after 500 history entries or whatever. Also I want commands to be saved to the history immediately when I run them, not only when I exit the shell session (<strong>shell</strong>)</li>
<li><strong>a useful prompt</strong>: I can&rsquo;t live without having my <strong>current directory</strong> and <strong>current git branch</strong> in my prompt (<strong>shell</strong>)</li>
<li><strong>24-bit colour</strong>: this is important to me because I find it MUCH easier to theme neovim with 24-bit colour support than in a terminal with only 256 colours (<strong>terminal emulator</strong>)</li>
<li><strong>clipboard integration</strong> between vim and my operating system so that when I copy in Firefox, I can just press <code>p</code> in vim to paste (<strong>text editor</strong>, maybe the OS/terminal emulator too)</li>
<li><strong>good autocomplete</strong>: for example commands like git should have command-specific autocomplete (<strong>shell</strong>)</li>
<li><strong>having colours in <code>ls</code></strong> (<strong>shell config</strong>)</li>
<li><strong>a terminal theme I like</strong>: I spend a lot of time in my terminal, I want it to look nice and I want its theme to match my terminal editor&rsquo;s theme. (<strong>terminal emulator</strong>, <strong>text editor</strong>)</li>
<li><strong>automatic terminal fixing</strong>: If a programs prints out some weird escape
codes that mess up my terminal, I want that to automatically get reset so
that my terminal doesn&rsquo;t get messed up (<strong>shell</strong>)</li>
<li><strong>keybindings</strong>: I want <code>Ctrl+left arrow</code> to work (<strong>shell</strong> or <strong>application</strong>)</li>
<li><strong>being able to use the scroll wheel in programs like <code>less</code></strong>: (<strong>terminal emulator</strong> and <strong>applications</strong>)</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a million other terminal conveniences out there and different people
value different things, but those are the ones that I would be really unhappy
without.</p>
<h3 id="how-i-achieve-a-modern-experience">how I achieve a &ldquo;modern experience&rdquo;</h3>
<p>My basic approach is:</p>
<ol>
<li>use the <code>fish</code> shell. Mostly don&rsquo;t configure it, except to:
<ul>
<li>set the <code>EDITOR</code> environment variable to my favourite terminal editor</li>
<li>alias <code>ls</code> to <code>ls --color=auto</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>use any terminal emulator with 24-bit colour support. In the past I&rsquo;ve used
GNOME Terminal, Terminator, and iTerm, but I&rsquo;m not picky about this. I don&rsquo;t really
configure it other than to choose a font.</li>
<li>use <code>neovim</code>, with a configuration that I&rsquo;ve been very slowly building over the last 9 years or so (the last time I deleted my vim config and started from scratch was 9 years ago)</li>
<li>use the <a href="https://github.com/chriskempson/base16">base16 framework</a> to theme everything</li>
</ol>
<p>A few things that affect my approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>I don&rsquo;t spend a lot of time SSHed into other machines</li>
<li>I&rsquo;d rather use the mouse a little than come up with keyboard-based ways to do everything</li>
<li>I work on a lot of small projects, not one big project</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="some-out-of-the-box-options-for-a-modern-experience">some &ldquo;out of the box&rdquo; options for a &ldquo;modern&rdquo; experience</h3>
<p>What if you want a nice experience, but don&rsquo;t want to spend a lot of time on
configuration? Figuring out how to configure vim in a way that I was satisfied
with really did take me like ten years, which is a long time!</p>
<p>My best ideas for how to get a reasonable terminal experience with minimal
config are:</p>
<ul>
<li>shell: either <code>fish</code> or <code>zsh</code> with <a href="https://ohmyz.sh/">oh-my-zsh</a></li>
<li>terminal emulator: almost anything with 24-bit colour support, for example all of these are popular:
<ul>
<li>linux: GNOME Terminal, Konsole, Terminator, xfce4-terminal</li>
<li>mac: iTerm (Terminal.app doesn&rsquo;t have 256-colour support)</li>
<li>cross-platform: kitty, alacritty, wezterm, or ghostty</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>shell config:
<ul>
<li>set the <code>EDITOR</code> environment variable to your favourite terminal text
editor</li>
<li>maybe alias <code>ls</code> to <code>ls --color=auto</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>text editor: this is a tough one, maybe <a href="https://micro-editor.github.io/">micro</a> or <a href="https://helix-editor.com/">helix</a>? I haven&rsquo;t used
either of them seriously but they both seem like very cool projects and I
think it&rsquo;s amazing that you can just use all the usual GUI editor commands
(<code>Ctrl-C</code> to copy, <code>Ctrl-V</code> to paste, <code>Ctrl-A</code> to select all) in micro and
they do what you&rsquo;d expect. I would probably try switching to helix except
that retraining my vim muscle memory seems way too hard. Also helix doesn&rsquo;t
have a GUI or plugin system yet.</li>
</ul>
<p>Personally I <strong>wouldn&rsquo;t</strong> use xterm, rxvt, or Terminal.app as a terminal emulator,
because I&rsquo;ve found in the past that they&rsquo;re missing core features (like 24-bit
colour in Terminal.app&rsquo;s case) that make the terminal harder to use for me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to pretend that getting a &ldquo;modern&rdquo; terminal experience is easier
than it is though &ndash; I think there are two issues that make it hard. Let&rsquo;s talk
about them!</p>
<h3 id="issue-1-with-getting-to-a-modern-experience-the-shell">issue 1 with getting to a &ldquo;modern&rdquo; experience: the shell</h3>
<p>bash and zsh are by far the two most popular shells, and neither of them
provide a default experience that I would be happy using out of the box, for
example:</p>
<ul>
<li>you need to customize your prompt</li>
<li>they don&rsquo;t come with git completions by default, you have to set them up</li>
<li>by default, bash only stores 500 (!) lines of history and (at least on Mac OS)
zsh is only configured to store 2000 lines, which is still not a lot</li>
<li>I find bash&rsquo;s tab completion very frustrating, if there&rsquo;s more than
one match then you can&rsquo;t tab through them</li>
</ul>
<p>And even though <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2024/09/12/reasons-i--still--love-fish/">I love fish</a>, the fact
that it isn&rsquo;t POSIX does make it hard for a lot of folks to make the switch.</p>
<p>Of course it&rsquo;s totally possible to learn how to customize your prompt in bash
or whatever, and it doesn&rsquo;t even need to be that complicated (in bash I&rsquo;d
probably start with something like <code>export PS1='[\u@\h \W$(__git_ps1 &quot; (%s)&quot;)]\$ '</code>, or maybe use <a href="https://starship.rs/">starship</a>).
But each of these &ldquo;not complicated&rdquo; things really does add up and it&rsquo;s
especially tough if you need to keep your config in sync across several
systems.</p>
<p>An extremely popular solution to getting a &ldquo;modern&rdquo; shell experience is
<a href="https://ohmyz.sh/">oh-my-zsh</a>. It seems like a great project and I know a lot
of people use it very happily, but I&rsquo;ve struggled with configuration systems
like that in the past &ndash; it looks like right now the base oh-my-zsh adds about
3000 lines of config, and often I find that having an extra configuration
system makes it harder to debug what&rsquo;s happening when things go wrong. I
personally have a tendency to use the system to add a lot of extra plugins,
make my system slow, get frustrated that it&rsquo;s slow, and then delete it
completely and write a new config from scratch.</p>
<h3 id="issue-2-with-getting-to-a-modern-experience-the-text-editor">issue 2 with getting to a &ldquo;modern&rdquo; experience: the text editor</h3>
<p>In the terminal survey I ran recently, the most popular terminal text editors
by far were <code>vim</code>, <code>emacs</code>, and <code>nano</code>.</p>
<p>I think the main options for terminal text editors are:</p>
<ul>
<li>use vim or emacs and configure it to your liking, you can probably have any
feature you want if you put in the work</li>
<li>use nano and accept that you&rsquo;re going to have a pretty limited experience
(for example I don&rsquo;t think you can select text with the mouse and then &ldquo;cut&rdquo;
it in nano)</li>
<li>use <code>micro</code> or <code>helix</code> which seem to offer a pretty good out-of-the-box
experience, potentially occasionally run into issues with using a less
mainstream text editor</li>
<li>just avoid using a terminal text editor as much as possible, maybe use VSCode, use
VSCode&rsquo;s terminal for all your terminal needs, and mostly never edit files in
the terminal. Or I know a lot of people use <code>code</code> as their <code>EDITOR</code> in the terminal.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="issue-3-individual-applications">issue 3: individual applications</h3>
<p>The last issue is that sometimes individual programs that I use are kind of
annoying. For example on my Mac OS machine, <code>/usr/bin/sqlite3</code> doesn&rsquo;t support
the <code>Ctrl+Left Arrow</code> keyboard shortcut. Fixing this to get a reasonable
terminal experience in SQLite was a little complicated, I had to:</p>
<ul>
<li>realize why this is happening (Mac OS won&rsquo;t ship GNU tools, and &ldquo;Ctrl-Left arrow&rdquo; support comes from GNU readline)</li>
<li>find a workaround (install sqlite from homebrew, which does have readline support)</li>
<li>adjust my environment (put Homebrew&rsquo;s sqlite3 in my PATH)</li>
</ul>
<p>I find that debugging application-specific issues like this is really not easy
and often it doesn&rsquo;t feel &ldquo;worth it&rdquo; &ndash; often I&rsquo;ll end up just dealing with
various minor inconveniences because I don&rsquo;t want to spend hours investigating
them. The only reason I was even able to figure this one out at all is that
I&rsquo;ve been spending a huge amount of time thinking about the terminal recently.</p>
<p>A big part of having a &ldquo;modern&rdquo; experience using terminal programs is just
using newer terminal programs, for example I can&rsquo;t be bothered to learn a
keyboard shortcut to sort the columns in <code>top</code>, but in <code>htop</code>  I can just click
on a column heading with my mouse to sort it. So I use htop instead! But discovering new more &ldquo;modern&rdquo; command line tools isn&rsquo;t easy (though
I made <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2022/04/12/a-list-of-new-ish--command-line-tools/">a list here</a>),
finding ones that I actually like using in practice takes time, and if you&rsquo;re
SSHed into another machine, they won&rsquo;t always be there.</p>
<h3 id="everything-affects-everything-else">everything affects everything else</h3>
<p>Something I find tricky about configuring my terminal to make everything &ldquo;nice&rdquo;
is that changing one seemingly small thing about my workflow can really affect
everything else. For example right now I don&rsquo;t use tmux. But if I needed to use
tmux again (for example because I was doing a lot of work SSHed into another
machine), I&rsquo;d need to think about a few things, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>if I wanted tmux&rsquo;s copy to synchronize with my system clipboard over
SSH, I&rsquo;d need to make sure that my terminal emulator has <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/k1ydpn/a_guide_on_how_to_copy_text_from_anywhere/">OSC 52 support</a></li>
<li>if I wanted to use iTerm&rsquo;s tmux integration (which makes tmux tabs into iTerm
tabs), I&rsquo;d need to change how I configure colours &ndash; right now I set them
with a <a href="https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-shell/blob/588691ba71b47e75793ed9edfcfaa058326a6f41/scripts/base16-solarized-light.sh">shell script</a> that I run when my shell starts, but that means the
colours get lost when restoring a tmux session.</li>
</ul>
<p>and probably more things I haven&rsquo;t thought of. &ldquo;Using tmux means that I have to
change how I manage my colours&rdquo; sounds unlikely, but that really did happen to
me and I decided &ldquo;well, I don&rsquo;t want to change how I manage colours right now,
so I guess I&rsquo;m not using that feature!&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also hard to remember which features I&rsquo;m relying on &ndash; for example maybe
my current terminal <em>does</em> have OSC 52 support and because copying from tmux over SSH
has always Just Worked I don&rsquo;t even realize that that&rsquo;s something I need, and
then it mysteriously stops working when I switch terminals.</p>
<h3 id="change-things-slowly">change things slowly</h3>
<p>Personally even though I think my setup is not <em>that</em> complicated, it&rsquo;s taken
me 20 years to get to this point! Because terminal config changes are so likely
to have unexpected and hard-to-understand consequences, I&rsquo;ve found that if I
change a lot of terminal configuration all at once it makes it much harder to
understand what went wrong if there&rsquo;s a problem, which can be really
disorienting.</p>
<p>So I usually prefer to make pretty small changes, and accept that changes can
might take me a REALLY long time to get used to. For example I switched from
using <code>ls</code> to <a href="https://github.com/eza-community/eza">eza</a> a year or two ago and
while I like it (because <code>eza -l</code> prints human-readable file sizes by default)
I&rsquo;m still not quite sure about it. But also sometimes it&rsquo;s worth it to make a
big change, like I made the switch to fish (from bash) 10 years ago and I&rsquo;m
very happy I did.</p>
<h3 id="getting-a-modern-terminal-is-not-that-easy">getting a &ldquo;modern&rdquo; terminal is not that easy</h3>
<p>Trying to explain how &ldquo;easy&rdquo; it is to configure your terminal really just made
me think that it&rsquo;s kind of hard and that I still sometimes get confused.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve found that there&rsquo;s never one perfect way to configure things in the
terminal that will be compatible with every single other thing. I just need to
try stuff, figure out some kind of locally stable state that works for me, and
accept that if I start using a new tool it might disrupt the system and I might
need to rethink things.</p>

### ["Rules" that terminal programs follow](https://jvns.ca/blog/2024/11/26/terminal-rules/)

**来源**: Julia Evans

**摘要**: <p>Recently I&rsquo;ve been thinking about how everything that happens in the terminal
is some combination of:</p>
<ol>
<li>Your <strong>operating system</strong>&rsquo;s job</li>
<li>Your <strong>shell</strong>&rsquo;s job</li>
<li>Your <strong>terminal emulator</strong>&rsquo;s job</li>
<li>The job of <strong>whatever program you happen to be running</strong> (like <code>top</code> or <code>vim</code> or <code>cat</code>)</li>
</ol>
<p>The first three (your operating system, shell, and terminal emulator) are all kind of
known quantities &ndash; if you&rsquo;re using bash in GNOME Terminal on Linux, you can
more or less reason about how how all of those things interact, and some of
their behaviour is standardized by POSIX.</p>
<p>But the fourth one (&ldquo;whatever program you happen to be running&rdquo;) feels like it
could do ANYTHING. How are you supposed to know how a program is going to
behave?</p>
<p>This post is kind of long so here&rsquo;s a quick table of contents:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://jvns.ca/atom.xml#programs-behave-surprisingly-consistently">programs behave surprisingly consistently</a></li>
<li><a href="https://jvns.ca/atom.xml#these-are-meant-to-be-descriptive-not-prescriptive">these are meant to be descriptive, not prescriptive</a></li>

<li><a href="https://jvns.ca/atom.xml#these-rules-take-a-long-time-to-learn">these &ldquo;rules&rdquo; take a long time to learn</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="programs-behave-surprisingly-consistently">programs behave surprisingly consistently</h3>
<p>As far as I know, there are no real standards for how programs in the terminal
should behave &ndash; the closest things I know of are:</p>
<ul>
<li>POSIX, which mostly dictates how your terminal emulator / OS / shell should
work together. I think it does specify a few things about how core utilities like
<code>cp</code> should work but AFAIK it doesn&rsquo;t have anything to say about how for
example <code>htop</code> should behave.</li>
<li>these <a href="https://clig.dev/">command line interface guidelines</a></li>
</ul>
<p>But even though there are no standards, in my experience programs in the
terminal behave in a pretty consistent way. So I wanted to write down a list of
&ldquo;rules&rdquo; that in my experience programs mostly follow.</p>
<h3 id="these-are-meant-to-be-descriptive-not-prescriptive">these are meant to be descriptive, not prescriptive</h3>
<p>My goal here isn&rsquo;t to convince authors of terminal programs that they <em>should</em>
follow any of these rules. There are lots of exceptions to these and often
there&rsquo;s a good reason for those exceptions.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s very useful for me to know what behaviour to expect from a random new
terminal program that I&rsquo;m using. Instead of &ldquo;uh, programs could do literally
anything&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;ok, here are the basic rules I expect, and then I can keep a
short mental list of exceptions&rdquo;.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m just writing down what I&rsquo;ve observed about how programs behave in my 20
years of using the terminal, why I think they behave that way, and some
examples of cases where that rule is &ldquo;broken&rdquo;.</p>
<h3 id="it-s-not-always-obvious-which-rules-are-the-program-s-responsibility-to-implement">it&rsquo;s not always obvious which &ldquo;rules&rdquo; are the program&rsquo;s responsibility to implement</h3>
<p>There are a bunch of common conventions that I think are pretty clearly the
program&rsquo;s responsibility to implement, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>config files should go in <code>~/.BLAHrc</code> or <code>~/.config/BLAH/FILE</code> or <code>/etc/BLAH/</code> or something</li>
<li><code>--help</code> should print help text</li>
<li>programs should print &ldquo;regular&rdquo; output to stdout and errors to stderr</li>
</ul>
<p>But in this post I&rsquo;m going to focus on things that it&rsquo;s not 100% obvious are
the program&rsquo;s responsibility. For example it feels to me like a &ldquo;law of nature&rdquo;
that pressing <code>Ctrl-D</code> should quit a REPL, but programs often
need to explicitly implement support for it &ndash; even though <code>cat</code> doesn&rsquo;t need
to implement <code>Ctrl-D</code> support, <code>ipython</code> <a href="https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit/blob/a2a12300c635ab3c051566e363ed27d853af4b21/src/prompt_toolkit/shortcuts/prompt.py#L824-L837">does</a>. (more about that in &ldquo;rule 3&rdquo; below)</p>
<p>Understanding which things are the program&rsquo;s responsibility makes it much less
surprising when different programs&rsquo; implementations are slightly different.</p>
<h3 id="rule-1-noninteractive-programs-should-quit-when-you-press-ctrl-c">rule 1: noninteractive programs should quit when you press <code>Ctrl-C</code></h3>
<p>The main reason for this rule is that noninteractive programs will quit by
default on <code>Ctrl-C</code> if they don&rsquo;t set up a <code>SIGINT</code> signal handler, so this is
kind of a &ldquo;you should act like the default&rdquo; rule.</p>
<p>Something that trips a lot of people up is that this doesn&rsquo;t apply to
<strong>interactive</strong> programs like <code>python3</code> or <code>bc</code> or <code>less</code>. This is because in
an interactive program, <code>Ctrl-C</code> has a different job &ndash; if the program is
running an operation (like for example a search in <code>less</code> or some Python code
in <code>python3</code>), then <code>Ctrl-C</code> will interrupt that operation but not stop the
program.</p>
<p>As an example of how this works in an interactive program: here&rsquo;s the code <a href="https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit/blob/a2a12300c635ab3c051566e363ed27d853af4b21/src/prompt_toolkit/key_binding/bindings/vi.py#L2225">in prompt-toolkit</a> (the library that iPython uses for handling input)
that aborts a search when you press <code>Ctrl-C</code>.</p>
<h3 id="rule-2-tuis-should-quit-when-you-press-q">rule 2: TUIs should quit when you press <code>q</code></h3>
<p>TUI programs (like <code>less</code> or <code>htop</code>) will usually quit when you press <code>q</code>.</p>
<p>This rule doesn&rsquo;t apply to any program where pressing <code>q</code> to quit wouldn&rsquo;t make
sense, like <code>tmux</code> or text editors.</p>
<h3 id="rule-3-repls-should-quit-when-you-press-ctrl-d-on-an-empty-line">rule 3: REPLs should quit when you press <code>Ctrl-D</code> on an empty line</h3>
<p>REPLs (like <code>python3</code> or <code>ed</code>) will usually quit when you press <code>Ctrl-D</code> on an
empty line. This rule is similar to the <code>Ctrl-C</code> rule &ndash; the reason for this is
that by default if you&rsquo;re running a program (like <code>cat</code>) in &ldquo;cooked mode&rdquo;, then
the operating system will return an <code>EOF</code> when you press <code>Ctrl-D</code> on an empty
line.</p>
<p>Most of the REPLs I use (sqlite3, python3, fish, bash, etc) don&rsquo;t actually use
cooked mode, but they all implement this keyboard shortcut anyway to mimic the
default behaviour.</p>
<p>For example, here&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit/blob/a2a12300c635ab3c051566e363ed27d853af4b21/src/prompt_toolkit/shortcuts/prompt.py#L824-L837">the code in prompt-toolkit</a>
that quits when you press Ctrl-D, and here&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/bminor/bash/blob/6794b5478f660256a1023712b5fc169196ed0a22/lib/readline/readline.c#L658-L672">the same code in readline</a>.</p>
<p>I actually thought that this one was a &ldquo;Law of Terminal Physics&rdquo; until very
recently because I&rsquo;ve basically never seen it broken, but you can see that it&rsquo;s
just something that each individual input library has to implement in the links
above.</p>
<p>Someone pointed out that the Erlang REPL does not quit when you press <code>Ctrl-D</code>,
so I guess not every REPL follows this &ldquo;rule&rdquo;.</p>
<h3 id="rule-4-don-t-use-more-than-16-colours">rule 4: don&rsquo;t use more than 16 colours</h3>
<p>Terminal programs rarely use colours other than the base 16 ANSI colours. This
is because if you specify colours with a hex code, it&rsquo;s very likely to clash
with some users&rsquo; background colour. For example if I print out some text as
<code>#EEEEEE</code>, it would be almost invisible on a white background, though it would
look fine on a dark background.</p>
<p>But if you stick to the default 16 base colours, you have a much better chance
that the user has configured those colours in their terminal emulator so that
they work reasonably well with their background color. Another reason to stick
to the default base 16 colours is that it makes less assumptions about what
colours the terminal emulator supports.</p>
<p>The only programs I usually see breaking this &ldquo;rule&rdquo; are text editors, for
example Helix by default will use a purple background which is not a default
ANSI colour. It seems fine for Helix to break this rule since Helix isn&rsquo;t a
&ldquo;core&rdquo; program and I assume any Helix user who doesn&rsquo;t like that colorscheme
will just change the theme.</p>
<h3 id="rule-5-vaguely-support-readline-keybindings">rule 5: vaguely support readline keybindings</h3>
<p>Almost every program I use supports <code>readline</code> keybindings if it would make
sense to do so. For example, here are a bunch of different programs and a link
to where they define <code>Ctrl-E</code> to go to the end of the line:</p>
<ul>
<li>ipython (<a href="https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit/blob/a2a12300c635ab3c051566e363ed27d853af4b21/src/prompt_toolkit/key_binding/bindings/emacs.py#L72">Ctrl-E defined here</a>)</li>
<li>atuin (<a href="https://github.com/atuinsh/atuin/blob/a67cfc82fe0dc907a01f07a0fd625701e062a33b/crates/atuin/src/command/client/search/interactive.rs#L407">Ctrl-E defined here</a>)</li>
<li>fzf (<a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/blob/bb55045596d6d08445f3c6d320c3ec2b457462d1/src/terminal.go#L611">Ctrl-E defined here</a>)</li>
<li>zsh (<a href="https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh/blob/86d5f24a3d28541f242eb3807379301ea976de87/Src/Zle/zle_bindings.c#L94">Ctrl-E defined here</a>)</li>
<li>fish (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/blob/99fa8aaaa7956178973150a03ce4954ab17a197b/share/functions/fish_default_key_bindings.fish#L43">Ctrl-E defined here</a>)</li>
<li>tmux&rsquo;s command prompt (<a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux/blob/ae8f2208c98e3c2d6e3fe4cad2281dce8fd11f31/key-bindings.c#L490">Ctrl-E defined here</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>None of those programs actually uses <code>readline</code> directly, they just sort of
mimic emacs/readline keybindings. They don&rsquo;t always mimic them <em>exactly</em>: for
example atuin seems to use <code>Ctrl-A</code> as a prefix, so <code>Ctrl-A</code> doesn&rsquo;t go to the
beginning of the line.</p>
<p>Also all of these programs seem to implement their own internal cut and paste
buffers so you can delete a line with <code>Ctrl-U</code> and then paste it with <code>Ctrl-Y</code>.</p>
<p>The exceptions to this are:</p>
<ul>
<li>some programs (like <code>git</code>, <code>cat</code>, and <code>nc</code>) don&rsquo;t have any line editing support at all (except for backspace, <code>Ctrl-W</code>, and <code>Ctrl-U</code>)</li>
<li>as usual text editors are an exception, every text editor has its own
approach to editing text</li>
</ul>
<p>I wrote more about this &ldquo;what keybindings does a program support?&rdquo; question in
<a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2024/07/08/readline/">entering text in the terminal is complicated</a>.</p>
<h3 id="rule-5-1-ctrl-w-should-delete-the-last-word">rule 5.1: Ctrl-W should delete the last word</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never seen a program (other than a text editor) where <code>Ctrl-W</code> <em>doesn&rsquo;t</em>
delete the last word. This is similar to the <code>Ctrl-C</code> rule &ndash; by default if a
program is in &ldquo;cooked mode&rdquo;, the OS will delete the last word if you press
<code>Ctrl-W</code>, and delete the whole line if you press <code>Ctrl-U</code>. So usually programs
will imitate that behaviour.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t think of any exceptions to this other than text editors but if there
are I&rsquo;d love to hear about them!</p>
<h3 id="rule-6-disable-colours-when-writing-to-a-pipe">rule 6: disable colours when writing to a pipe</h3>
<p>Most programs will disable colours when writing to a pipe. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>rg blah</code> will highlight all occurrences of <code>blah</code> in the output, but if the
output is to a pipe or a file, it&rsquo;ll turn off the highlighting.</li>
<li><code>ls --color=auto</code> will use colour when writing to a terminal, but not when
writing to a pipe</li>
</ul>
<p>Both of those programs will also format their output differently when writing
to the terminal: <code>ls</code> will organize files into columns, and ripgrep will group
matches with headings.</p>
<p>If you want to force the program to use colour (for example because you want to
look at the colour), you can use <code>unbuffer</code> to force the program&rsquo;s output to be
a tty like this:</p>
<pre><code>unbuffer rg blah |  less -R
</code></pre>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that there are some programs that &ldquo;break&rdquo; this rule but I can&rsquo;t think
of any examples right now. Some programs have an <code>--color</code> flag that you can
use to force colour to be on, in the example above you could also do <code>rg --color=always | less -R</code>.</p>
<h3 id="rule-7-means-stdin-stdout">rule 7: <code>-</code> means stdin/stdout</h3>
<p>Usually if you pass <code>-</code> to a program instead of a filename, it&rsquo;ll read from
stdin or write to stdout (whichever is appropriate). For example, if you want
to format the Python code that&rsquo;s on your clipboard with <code>black</code> and then copy
it, you could run:</p>
<pre><code>pbpaste | black - | pbcopy
</code></pre>
<p>(<code>pbpaste</code> is a Mac program, you can do something similar on Linux with <code>xclip</code>)</p>
<p>My impression is that most programs implement this if it would make sense and I
can&rsquo;t think of any exceptions right now, but I&rsquo;m sure there are many
exceptions.</p>
<h3 id="these-rules-take-a-long-time-to-learn">these &ldquo;rules&rdquo; take a long time to learn</h3>
<p>These rules took me a long time for me to learn because I had to:</p>
<ol>
<li>learn that the rule applied anywhere at all (&quot;<code>Ctrl-C</code> will exit programs&quot;)</li>
<li>notice some exceptions (&ldquo;okay, <code>Ctrl-C</code> will exit <code>find</code> but not <code>less</code>&rdquo;)</li>
<li>subconsciously figure out what the pattern is (&quot;<code>Ctrl-C</code> will generally quit
noninteractive programs, but in interactive programs it might interrupt the
current operation instead of quitting the program&quot;)</li>
<li>eventually maybe formulate it into an explicit rule that I know</li>
</ol>
<p>A lot of my understanding of the terminal is honestly still in the
&ldquo;subconscious pattern recognition&rdquo; stage. The only reason I&rsquo;ve been taking the
time to make things explicit at all is because I&rsquo;ve been trying to explain how
it works to others. Hopefully writing down these &ldquo;rules&rdquo; explicitly will make
learning some of this stuff a little bit faster for others.</p>

### [Why pipes sometimes get "stuck": buffering](https://jvns.ca/blog/2024/11/29/why-pipes-get-stuck-buffering/)

**来源**: Julia Evans

**摘要**: <p>Here&rsquo;s a niche terminal problem that has bothered me for years but that I never
really understood until a few weeks ago. Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re running this command
to watch for some specific output in a log file:</p>
<pre><code>tail -f /some/log/file | grep thing1 | grep thing2
</code></pre>
<p>If log lines are being added to the file relatively slowly, the result I&rsquo;d see
is&hellip; nothing! It doesn&rsquo;t matter if there were matches in the log file or not,
there just wouldn&rsquo;t be any output.</p>
<p>I internalized this as &ldquo;uh, I guess pipes just get stuck sometimes and don&rsquo;t
show me the output, that&rsquo;s weird&rdquo;, and I&rsquo;d handle it by just
running <code>grep thing1 /some/log/file | grep thing2</code> instead, which would work.</p>
<p>So as I&rsquo;ve been doing a terminal deep dive over the last few months I was
really excited to finally learn exactly why this happens.</p>
<h3 id="why-this-happens-buffering">why this happens: buffering</h3>
<p>The reason why &ldquo;pipes get stuck&rdquo; sometimes is that it&rsquo;s VERY common for
programs to buffer their output before writing it to a pipe or file. So the
pipe is working fine, the problem is that the program never even wrote the data
to the pipe!</p>
<p>This is for performance reasons: writing all output immediately as soon as you
can uses more system calls, so it&rsquo;s more efficient to save up data until you
have 8KB or so of data to write (or until the program exits) and THEN write it
to the pipe.</p>
<p>In this example:</p>
<pre><code>tail -f /some/log/file | grep thing1 | grep thing2
</code></pre>
<p>the problem is that <code>grep thing1</code> is saving up all of its matches until it has
8KB of data to write, which might literally never happen.</p>
<h3 id="programs-don-t-buffer-when-writing-to-a-terminal">programs don&rsquo;t buffer when writing to a terminal</h3>
<p>Part of why I found this so disorienting is that <code>tail -f file | grep thing</code>
will work totally fine, but then when you add the second <code>grep</code>, it stops
working!! The reason for this is that the way <code>grep</code> handles buffering depends
on whether it&rsquo;s writing to a terminal or not.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how <code>grep</code> (and many other programs) decides to buffer its output:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check if stdout is a terminal or not using the <code>isatty</code> function
<ul>
<li>If it&rsquo;s a terminal, use line buffering (print every line immediately as soon as you have it)</li>
<li>Otherwise, use &ldquo;block buffering&rdquo; &ndash; only print data if you have at least 8KB or so of data to print</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So if <code>grep</code> is writing directly to your terminal then you&rsquo;ll see the line as
soon as it&rsquo;s printed, but if it&rsquo;s writing to a pipe, you won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Of course the buffer size isn&rsquo;t always 8KB for every program, it depends on the implementation. For <code>grep</code> the buffering is handled by libc, and libc&rsquo;s buffer size is
defined in the <code>BUFSIZ</code> variable. <a href="https://github.com/bminor/glibc/blob/c69e8cccaff8f2d89cee43202623b33e6ef5d24a/libio/stdio.h#L100">Here&rsquo;s where that&rsquo;s defined in glibc</a>.</p>
<p>(as an aside: &ldquo;programs do not use 8KB output buffers when writing to a
terminal&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t, like, a law of terminal physics, a program COULD use an 8KB
buffer when writing output to a terminal if it wanted, it would just be
extremely weird if it did that, I can&rsquo;t think of any program that behaves that
way)</p>
<h3 id="commands-that-buffer-commands-that-don-t">commands that buffer &amp; commands that don&rsquo;t</h3>
<p>One annoying thing about this buffering behaviour is that you kind of need to
remember which commands buffer their output when writing to a pipe.</p>
<p>Some commands that <strong>don&rsquo;t</strong> buffer their output:</p>
<ul>
<li>tail</li>
<li>cat</li>
<li>tee</li>
</ul>
<p>I think almost everything else will buffer output, especially if it&rsquo;s a command
where you&rsquo;re likely to be using it for batch processing. Here&rsquo;s a list of some
common commands that buffer their output when writing to a pipe, along with the
flag that disables block buffering.</p>
<ul>
<li>grep (<code>--line-buffered</code>)</li>
<li>sed (<code>-u</code>)</li>
<li>awk (there&rsquo;s a <code>fflush()</code> function)</li>
<li>tcpdump (<code>-l</code>)</li>
<li>jq (<code>-u</code>)</li>
<li>tr (<code>-u</code>)</li>
<li>cut (can&rsquo;t disable buffering)</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are all the ones I can think of, lots of unix commands (like <code>sort</code>) may
or may not buffer their output but it doesn&rsquo;t matter because <code>sort</code> can&rsquo;t do
anything until it finishes receiving input anyway.</p>
<p>Also I did my best to test both the Mac OS and GNU versions of these but there
are a lot of variations and I might have made some mistakes.</p>
<h3 id="programming-languages-where-the-default-print-statement-buffers">programming languages where the default &ldquo;print&rdquo; statement buffers</h3>
<p>Also, here are a few programming language where the default print statement
will buffer output when writing to a pipe, and some ways to disable buffering
if you want:</p>
<ul>
<li>C (disable with <code>setvbuf</code>)</li>
<li>Python (disable with <code>python -u</code>, or <code>PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1</code>, or <code>sys.stdout.reconfigure(line_buffering=False)</code>, or <code>print(x, flush=True)</code>)</li>
<li>Ruby (disable with <code>STDOUT.sync = true</code>)</li>
<li>Perl (disable with <code>$| = 1</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>I assume that these languages are designed this way so that the default print
function will be fast when you&rsquo;re doing batch processing.</p>
<p>Also whether output is buffered or not might depend on how you print, for
example in C++ <code>cout &lt;&lt; &quot;hello\n&quot;</code> buffers when writing to a pipe but <code>cout &lt;&lt; &quot;hello&quot; &lt;&lt; endl</code> will flush its output.</p>
<h3 id="when-you-press-ctrl-c-on-a-pipe-the-contents-of-the-buffer-are-lost">when you press <code>Ctrl-C</code> on a pipe, the contents of the buffer are lost</h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re running this command as a hacky way to watch for DNS requests
to <code>example.com</code>, and you forgot to pass <code>-l</code> to tcpdump:</p>
<pre><code>sudo tcpdump -ni any port 53 | grep example.com
</code></pre>
<p>When you press <code>Ctrl-C</code>, what happens? In a magical perfect world, what I would
<em>want</em> to happen is for <code>tcpdump</code> to flush its buffer, <code>grep</code> would search for
<code>example.com</code>, and I would see all the output I missed.</p>
<p>But in the real world, what happens is that all the programs get killed and the
output in <code>tcpdump</code>&rsquo;s buffer is lost.</p>
<p>I think this problem is probably unavoidable &ndash; I spent a little time with
<code>strace</code> to see how this works and <code>grep</code> receives the <code>SIGINT</code> before
<code>tcpdump</code> anyway so even if <code>tcpdump</code> tried to flush its buffer <code>grep</code> would
already be dead.</p>
<small>
<p>After a little more investigation, there is a workaround: if you find
<code>tcpdump</code>&rsquo;s PID and <code>kill -TERM $PID</code>, then tcpdump will flush the buffer so
you can see the output. That&rsquo;s kind of a pain but I tested it and it seems to
work.</p>
</small>
<h3 id="redirecting-to-a-file-also-buffers">redirecting to a file also buffers</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just pipes, this will also buffer:</p>
<pre><code>sudo tcpdump -ni any port 53 &gt; output.txt
</code></pre>
<p>Redirecting to a file doesn&rsquo;t have the same &ldquo;<code>Ctrl-C</code> will totally destroy the
contents of the buffer&rdquo; problem though &ndash; in my experience it usually behaves
more like you&rsquo;d want, where the contents of the buffer get written to the file
before the program exits. I&rsquo;m not 100% sure whether this is something you can
always rely on or not.</p>
<h3 id="a-bunch-of-potential-ways-to-avoid-buffering">a bunch of potential ways to avoid buffering</h3>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s talk solutions. Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;ve run this command:</p>
<pre><code>tail -f /some/log/file | grep thing1 | grep thing2
</code></pre>
<p>I asked people on Mastodon how they would solve this in practice and there were
5 basic approaches. Here they are:</p>
<h4 id="solution-1-run-a-program-that-finishes-quickly">solution 1: run a program that finishes quickly</h4>
<p>Historically my solution to this has been to just avoid the &ldquo;command writing to
pipe slowly&rdquo; situation completely and instead run a program that will finish quickly
like this:</p>
<pre><code>cat /some/log/file | grep thing1 | grep thing2 | tail
</code></pre>
<p>This doesn&rsquo;t do the same thing as the original command but it does mean that
you get to avoid thinking about these weird buffering issues.</p>
<p>(you could also do <code>grep thing1 /some/log/file</code> but I often prefer to use an
&ldquo;unnecessary&rdquo; <code>cat</code>)</p>
<h4 id="solution-2-remember-the-line-buffer-flag-to-grep">solution 2: remember the &ldquo;line buffer&rdquo; flag to grep</h4>
<p>You could remember that grep has a flag to avoid buffering and pass it like this:</p>
<pre><code>tail -f /some/log/file | grep --line-buffered thing1 | grep thing2
</code></pre>
<h4 id="solution-3-use-awk">solution 3: use awk</h4>
<p>Some people said that if they&rsquo;re specifically dealing with a multiple greps
situation, they&rsquo;ll rewrite it to use a single <code>awk</code> instead, like this:</p>
<pre><code>tail -f /some/log/file |  awk '/thing1/ &amp;&amp; /thing2/'
</code></pre>
<p>Or you would write a more complicated <code>grep</code>, like this:</p>
<pre><code>tail -f /some/log/file |  grep -E 'thing1.*thing2'
</code></pre>
<p>(<code>awk</code> also buffers, so for this to work you&rsquo;ll want <code>awk</code> to be the last command in the pipeline)</p>
<h4 id="solution-4-use-stdbuf">solution 4: use <code>stdbuf</code></h4>
<p><code>stdbuf</code> uses LD_PRELOAD to turn off libc&rsquo;s buffering, and you can use it to turn off output buffering like this:</p>
<pre><code>tail -f /some/log/file | stdbuf -o0 grep thing1 | grep thing2
</code></pre>
<p>Like any <code>LD_PRELOAD</code> solution it&rsquo;s a bit unreliable &ndash; it doesn&rsquo;t work on
static binaries, I think won&rsquo;t work if the program isn&rsquo;t using libc&rsquo;s
buffering, and doesn&rsquo;t always work on Mac OS. Harry Marr has a really nice <a href="https://hmarr.com/blog/how-stdbuf-works/">How stdbuf works</a> post.</p>
<h4 id="solution-5-use-unbuffer">solution 5: use <code>unbuffer</code></h4>
<p><code>unbuffer program</code> will force the program&rsquo;s output to be a TTY, which means
that it&rsquo;ll behave the way it normally would on a TTY (less buffering, colour
output, etc). You could use it in this example like this:</p>
<pre><code>tail -f /some/log/file | unbuffer grep thing1 | grep thing2
</code></pre>
<p>Unlike <code>stdbuf</code> it will always work, though it might have unwanted side
effects, for example <code>grep thing1</code>&rsquo;s will also colour matches.</p>
<p>If you want to install unbuffer, it&rsquo;s in the <code>expect</code> package.</p>
<h3 id="that-s-all-the-solutions-i-know-about">that&rsquo;s all the solutions I know about!</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bit hard for me to say which one is &ldquo;best&rdquo;, I think personally I&rsquo;m
mostly likely to use <code>unbuffer</code> because I know it&rsquo;s always going to work.</p>
<p>If I learn about more solutions I&rsquo;ll try to add them to this post.</p>
<h3 id="i-m-not-really-sure-how-often-this-comes-up">I&rsquo;m not really sure how often this comes up</h3>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s not very common for me to have a program that slowly trickles data
into a pipe like this, normally if I&rsquo;m using a pipe a bunch of data gets
written very quickly, processed by everything in the pipeline, and then
everything exits. The only examples I can come up with right now are:</p>
<ul>
<li>tcpdump</li>
<li><code>tail -f</code></li>
<li>watching log files in a different way like with <code>kubectl logs</code></li>
<li>the output of a slow computation</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-if-there-were-an-environment-variable-to-disable-buffering">what if there were an environment variable to disable buffering?</h3>
<p>I think it would be cool if there were a standard environment variable to turn
off buffering, like <code>PYTHONUNBUFFERED</code> in Python. I got this idea from a
<a href="https://blog.plover.com/Unix/stdio-buffering.html">couple</a> of <a href="https://blog.plover.com/Unix/stdio-buffering-2.html">blog posts</a> by Mark Dominus
in 2018. Maybe <code>NO_BUFFER</code> like <a href="https://no-color.org/">NO_COLOR</a>?</p>
<p>The design seems tricky to get right; Mark points out that NETBSD has <a href="https://man.netbsd.org/setbuf.3">environment variables called <code>STDBUF</code>, <code>STDBUF1</code>, etc</a> which gives you a
ton of control over buffering but I imagine most developers don&rsquo;t want to
implement many different environment variables to handle a relatively minor
edge case.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also curious about whether there are any programs that just automatically
flush their output buffers after some period of time (like 1 second). It feels
like it would be nice in theory but I can&rsquo;t think of any program that does that
so I imagine there are some downsides.</p>
<h3 id="stuff-i-left-out">stuff I left out</h3>
<p>Some things I didn&rsquo;t talk about in this post since these posts have been
getting pretty long recently and seriously does anyone REALLY want to read 3000
words about buffering?</p>
<ul>
<li>the difference between line buffering and having totally unbuffered output</li>
<li>how buffering to stderr is different from buffering to stdout</li>
<li>this post is only about buffering that happens <strong>inside the program</strong>, your
operating system&rsquo;s TTY driver also does a little bit of buffering sometimes</li>
<li>other reasons you might need to flush your output other than &ldquo;you&rsquo;re writing
to a pipe&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

### [Introducing arborium, a tree-sitter distribution](https://fasterthanli.me/articles/introducing-arborium)

**摘要**: <p>About two weeks ago I entered a discussion with the docs.rs team about,

### [crates.io phishing attempt](https://fasterthanli.me/articles/crates-io-phishing-attempt)

**来源**: Amos (fasterthanlime)

**摘要**: <p>Earlier this week, an <a href="https://fasterthanli.me/articles/color-npm-package-compromised">npm supply chain attack</a>.</p>

<p>It’s turn for <a href="https://crates.io">crates.io</a>, the main public repository for <a href="https://rust-lang.org">Rust</a>
crates (packages).</p>

<p>The phishing e-mail looks like this:</p>

<figure class="paragraph-like"><source media="(max-width: 400px)" type="image/jxl" /><source type="image/jxl" /><source media="(max-width: 400px)" type="image/avif" /><source type="image/avif" /><source media="(max-width: 400px)" type="image/webp" /><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="A phishing e-mail: Important: Breach notification regarding crates.io  Hi, BurntSushi! We recently discovered that an unauthorized actor had compromised the crates.io infrastructure and accessed a limited amount of user information. The attacker's access was revoked, and we are currently reviewing our security posture. We are currently drafting a blog post to outline the timeline and the steps we took to mitigate this. In the meantime, we strongly suggest you to rotate your login info by signing in here to our internal SSO, which is a temporary fix to ensure that the attacker cannot modify any packages published by you.

<p>The <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/governance/teams/dev-tools#team-crates-io">crates.io team</a> has acknowledged
the attack and said they’d see if they can do something about it.</p>

### [color npm package compromised](https://fasterthanli.me/articles/color-npm-package-compromised)

**来源**: Amos (fasterthanlime)

**摘要**: <p>On September 8 2025, around 13:00 UTC, someone compromised <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/~qix">Josh Junon’s npm
account (qix)</a> and started publishing backdoored
versions of his package.</p>

<p>Someone noticed and let Josh know:</p>

Your npm account seems to have been compromised. 1 hour ago it started posting packages with backdoors to all your popular packages.

**来源**: Amos (fasterthanlime)

**摘要**: <p>I do not come to you with answers today, but rather some observations and a lot of questions.</p>

<a class="anchor" href="https://fasterthanli.me/index.xml#the-weird-glitch" id="the-weird-glitch"><h2>The weird glitch</h2></a>
<p>Recently I was editing some video and I noticed this:</p>

<p>

Some of them are black, some of them are white. The image itself shows some blue and white text composited on some blurry background, which doesn’t really matter for this, and there’s a red line horizontal up in the image. It’s very confusing." height="1126" src="https://cdn.fasterthanli.me/content/articles/all-color-is-best-effort/dvr-circles@2x~3c031f1f42693336.jxl" title="A screenshot of the video, there are visible circles at various places in the image.

It’s very confusing." width="1966" /></p>

<p>Not what the finger is pointing at — the dots.</p>

<p>Here are the separate layers this image is made up of: the background is a stock image
I’ve licensed from Envato Elements:</p>

<p>Because I use it as a background image, I’ve cranked down the exposition in the Color tab:</p>
