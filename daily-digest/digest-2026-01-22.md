### [Claude's new constitution](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/mLvxxoNjDqDHBAo6K/claude-s-new-constitution)

**来源**: LessWrong - AI

**摘要**: Published on January 21, 2026 7:37 PM GMT<br /><br /><p><a href="http://anthropic.com/constitution"><strong>Read the constitution</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Previously: 'soul document' discussion <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/vpNG99GhbBoLov9og/claude-4-5-opus-soul-document">here</a>; the new constitution contains almost all of the 'soul document' content, but is &gt;2x longer with a lot of new additions.</p>
<p>(Zac and Drake work at Anthropic but are just sharing the linkpost and weren't heavily involved in writing this document.)</p>
<hr />
<p>We're publishing a new constitution for our AI model, Claude. It's a detailed description of Anthropic's vision for Claude's values and behavior; a holistic document that explains the context in which Claude operates and the kind of entity we would like Claude to be.</p>
<p>The constitution is a crucial part of our model training process, and its content directly shapes Claude's behavior. Training models is a difficult task, and Claude's outputs might not always adhere to the constitution's ideals. But we think that the way the new constitution is written—with a thorough explanation of our intentions and the reasons behind them—makes it more likely to cultivate good values during training.</p>
<p>In this post, we describe what we've included in the new constitution and some of the considerations that informed our approach.</p>
<p><em>We're releasing Claude's constitution in full under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Deed</a>, meaning it can be freely used by anyone for any purpose without asking for permission.</em></p>
<h2>What is Claude's Constitution?</h2>
<p>Claude's constitution is the foundational document that both expresses and shapes who Claude is. It contains detailed explanations of the values we would like Claude to embody and the reasons why. In it, we explain what we think it means for Claude to be helpful while remaining broadly safe, ethical, and compliant with our guidelines. The constitution gives Claude information about its situation and offers advice for how to deal with difficult situations and tradeoffs, like balancing honesty with compassion and the protection of sensitive information. Although it might sound surprising, the constitution is written <em>primarily for Claude</em>. It is intended to give Claude the knowledge and understanding it needs to act well in the world.</p>
<p>We treat the constitution as the final authority on how we want Claude to be and to behave—that is, any other training or instruction given to Claude should be consistent with both its letter and its underlying spirit. This makes publishing the constitution particularly important from a transparency perspective: it lets people understand which of Claude's behaviors are intended versus unintended, to make informed choices, and to provide useful feedback. We think transparency of this kind will become ever more important as AIs start to exert more influence in society<span class="footnote-reference" id="fnref-hYoiwc7XdXuA2cvRH-1">
      <sup><a class="" href="https://www.lesswrong.com/feed.xml?view=community-rss&amp;karmaThreshold=30#fn-hYoiwc7XdXuA2cvRH-1">[1]</a></sup>
    </span>.</p>
<p>We use the constitution at various stages of the training process. This has grown out of training techniques we've been using since 2023, when we first began training Claude models using <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/constitutional-ai-harmlessness-from-ai-feedback">Constitutional AI</a>. Our approach has evolved significantly since then, and the new constitution plays an even more central role in training.</p>
<p>Claude itself also uses the constitution to construct many kinds of synthetic training data, including data that helps it learn and understand the constitution, conversations where the constitution might be relevant, responses that are in line with its values, and rankings of possible responses. All of these can be used to train future versions of Claude to become the kind of entity the constitution describes. This practical function has shaped how we've written the constitution: it needs to work both as a statement of abstract ideals <em>and</em> a useful artifact for training.</p>
<h2>Our new approach to Claude's Constitution</h2>
<p>Our previous <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claudes-constitution">Constitution</a> was composed of a list of standalone principles. We've come to believe that a different approach is necessary. We think that in order to be good actors in the world, AI models like Claude need to understand <em>why</em> we want them to behave in certain ways, and we need to explain this to them rather than merely specify <em>what</em> we want them to do. If we want models to exercise good judgment across a wide range of novel situations, they need to be able to generalize—to apply broad principles rather than mechanically following specific rules.</p>
<p>Specific rules and bright lines sometimes have their advantages. They can make models' actions more predictable, transparent, and testable, and we do use them for some especially high-stakes behaviors in which Claude should never engage (we call these "hard constraints"). But such rules can also be applied poorly in unanticipated situations or when followed too rigidly<span class="footnote-reference" id="fnref-hYoiwc7XdXuA2cvRH-2">
      <sup><a class="" href="https://www.lesswrong.com/feed.xml?view=community-rss&amp;karmaThreshold=30#fn-hYoiwc7XdXuA2cvRH-2">[2]</a></sup>
    </span>. We don't intend for the constitution to be a rigid legal document—and legal constitutions aren't necessarily like this anyway.</p>
<p>The constitution reflects our current thinking about how to approach a dauntingly novel and high-stakes project: creating safe, beneficial non-human entities whose capabilities may come to rival or exceed our own. Although the document is no doubt flawed in many ways, we want it to be something future models can look back on and see as an honest and sincere attempt to help Claude understand its situation, our motives, and the reasons we shape Claude in the ways we do.</p>
<h2>A brief summary of the new constitution</h2>
<p>In order to be both safe and beneficial, we want all current Claude models to be:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Broadly safe</strong>: not undermining appropriate human mechanisms to oversee AI during the current phase of development;</li>
<li><strong>Broadly ethical</strong>: being honest, acting according to good values, and avoiding actions that are inappropriate, dangerous, or harmful;</li>
<li><strong>Compliant with Anthropic's guidelines</strong>: acting in accordance with more specific guidelines from Anthropic where relevant;</li>
<li><strong>Genuinely helpful</strong>: benefiting the operators and users they interact with.</li>
</ol>
<p>In cases of apparent conflict, Claude should generally prioritize these properties in the order in which they're listed.</p>
<p>Most of the constitution is focused on giving more detailed explanations and guidance about these priorities. The main sections are as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Helpfulness.</strong> In this section, we emphasize the immense value that Claude being genuinely and substantively helpful can provide for users and for the world. Claude can be like a brilliant friend who also has the knowledge of a doctor, lawyer, and financial advisor, who will speak frankly and from a place of genuine care and treat users like intelligent adults capable of deciding what is good for them. We also discuss how Claude should navigate helpfulness across its different "principals"—Anthropic itself, the operators who build on our API, and the end users. We offer heuristics for weighing helpfulness against other values.</p>
<p><strong>Anthropic's guidelines.</strong> This section discusses how Anthropic might give supplementary instructions to Claude about how to handle specific issues, such as medical advice, cybersecurity requests, jailbreaking strategies, and tool integrations. These guidelines often reflect detailed knowledge or context that Claude doesn't have by default, and we want Claude to prioritize complying with them over more general forms of helpfulness. But we want Claude to recognize that Anthropic's deeper intention is for Claude to behave safely and ethically, and that these guidelines should never conflict with the constitution as a whole.</p>
<p><strong>Claude's ethics.</strong> Our central aim is for Claude to be a good, wise, and virtuous agent, exhibiting skill, judgment, nuance, and sensitivity in handling real-world decision-making, including in the context of moral uncertainty and disagreement. In this section, we discuss the high standards of honesty we want Claude to hold, and the nuanced reasoning we want Claude to use in weighing the values at stake when avoiding harm. We also discuss our current list of hard constraints on Claude's behavior—for example, that Claude should never provide significant uplift to a bioweapons attack.</p>
<p><strong>Being broadly safe.</strong> Claude should not undermine humans' ability to oversee and correct its values and behavior during this critical period of AI development. In this section, we discuss how we want Claude to prioritize this sort of safety even above ethics—not because we think safety is ultimately more important than ethics, but because current models can make mistakes or behave in harmful ways due to mistaken beliefs, flaws in their values, or limited understanding of context. It's crucial that we continue to be able to oversee model behavior and, if necessary, prevent Claude models from taking action.</p>
<p><strong>Claude's nature.</strong> In this section, we express our uncertainty about whether Claude might have some kind of consciousness or moral status (either now or in the future). We discuss how we hope Claude will approach questions about its nature, identity, and place in the world. Sophisticated AIs are a genuinely new kind of entity, and the questions they raise bring us to the edge of existing scientific and philosophical understanding. Amidst such uncertainty, we care about Claude's psychological security, sense of self, and wellbeing, both for Claude's own sake and because these qualities may bear on Claude's integrity, judgment, and safety. We hope that humans and AIs can explore this together.</p>
<p>We're releasing the full text of the constitution today, and we aim to release additional materials in the future that will be helpful for training, evaluation, and transparency.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Claude's constitution is a living document and a continuous work in progress. This is new territory, and we expect to make mistakes (and hopefully correct them) along the way. Nevertheless, we hope it offers meaningful transparency into the values and priorities we believe should guide Claude's behavior. To that end, we will maintain an up-to-date version of Claude's constitution on our website.</p>
<p>While writing the constitution, we sought feedback from various external experts (as well as asking for input from prior iterations of Claude). We'll likely continue to do so for future versions of the document, from experts in law, philosophy, theology, psychology, and a wide range of other disciplines. Over time, we hope that an external community can arise to critique documents like this, encouraging us and others to be increasingly thoughtful.</p>
<p>This constitution is written for our mainline, general-access Claude models. We have some models built for specialized uses that don't fully fit this constitution; as we continue to develop products for specialized use cases, we will continue to evaluate how to best ensure our models meet the core objectives outlined in this constitution.</p>
<p>Although the constitution expresses our vision for Claude, training models towards that vision is an ongoing technical challenge. We will continue to be open about any ways in which model behavior comes apart from our vision, such as in <a href="https://assets.anthropic.com/m/64823ba7485345a7/Claude-Opus-4-5-System-Card.pdf">our system cards</a>. Readers of the constitution should keep this gap between intention and reality in mind.</p>
<p>Even if we succeed with our current training methods at creating models that fit our vision, we might fail later as models become more capable. For this and other reasons, alongside the constitution, we <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research">continue to pursue</a> a broad portfolio of methods and tools to help us assess and improve the alignment of our models: new and more rigorous evaluations, safeguards to prevent misuse, detailed investigations of actual and potential alignment failures, and interpretability tools that help us understand at a deeper level how the models work.</p>
<p>At some point in the future, and perhaps soon, documents like Claude's constitution might matter a lot—much more than they do now. Powerful AI models will be a new kind of force in the world, and those who are creating them have a chance to help them embody the best in humanity. We hope this new constitution is a step in that direction.</p>

<li class="footnote-item" id="fn-hYoiwc7XdXuA2cvRH-2"><p>Training on rigid rules might negatively affect a model's character more generally.

### [The case for AGI safety products](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/iwfdwzJerpC7FqbZG/the-case-for-agi-safety-products)

**来源**: LessWrong - AI

**摘要**: Published on January 21, 2026 5:23 PM GMT<br /><br /><p><i>This is a personal post and does not necessarily reflect the opinion of other members of Apollo Research. This blogpost is paired with our announcement that </i><a href="https://www.apolloresearch.ai/blog/apollo-research-is-becoming-a-pbc/"><i>Apollo Research is spinning out from fiscal sponsorship into a PBC</i></a><i>.</i></p><p><strong>Summary of main claims:</strong></p><ul><li>There is a set of safety tools and research that both meaningfully increases AGI safety and is profitable. Let’s call these&nbsp;<i>AGI safety products</i>.<ul><li>By AGI, I mean systems that are capable of automating AI safety research, e.g., competently running research projects that would take an expert human 6 months or longer. I think these arguments are less clear for&nbsp;<i>ASI safety</i>.</li></ul></li><li>At least in some cases, the incentives for meaningfully increasing AGI safety and creating a profitable business are aligned enough that it makes sense to build mission-driven, for-profit companies focused on AGI safety products.</li><li>If we take AGI and its economic implications seriously, it’s likely that billion-dollar AGI safety companies will emerge, and it is essential that these companies genuinely attempt to mitigate frontier risks.</li><li>Automated AI safety research requires scale. For-profits are typically more compatible with that scale than non-profits.</li><li>While non-safety-motivated actors might eventually build safety companies purely for profit, this is arguably too late, as AGI risks require proactive solutions, not reactive ones.&nbsp;</li><li>The AGI safety product thesis has&nbsp;<i>several limitations and caveats</i>. Most importantly, many research endeavors within AGI safety are NOT well-suited for for-profit entities, and a lot of important work is better placed in non-profits or governments.</li><li>I’m not fully confident in this hypothesis, but I’m confident enough to think that it is impactful for more people to explore the direction of AGI safety products.</li></ul><h1>Definition of AGI safety products</h1><p><i>Products that both meaningfully increase AGI safety and are profitable</i></p><p>Desiderata / Requirements for AGI products include:</p><ul><li>Directly and&nbsp;<strong>differentially speed up AGI safety</strong>, e.g., by providing better tooling or evaluations for alignment teams at AGI companies.&nbsp;</li><li>Are&nbsp;<strong>“on the path to AGI,”</strong> i.e., there is a clear hypothesis why these efforts would increase safety for AGI-level systems. For example, architecture-agnostic mechanistic interpretability tools would likely enable a deeper understanding of any kind of frontier AI system.&nbsp;</li><li>Lead to the&nbsp;<strong>safer deployment of frontier AI agents</strong>, e.g., by providing monitoring and control.</li><li>The&nbsp;<strong>feedback from the market translates into increased frontier safety</strong>. In other words, improving the product for the customer also increases&nbsp;<i>frontier&nbsp;</i>safety, rather than pulling work away from the frontier.&nbsp;</li><li>Building these<strong> tools is profitable</strong>.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>There are multiple fields that I expect to be very compatible with AGI safety products:</p><ul><li><strong>Evaluations:</strong> building out tools to automate the generation, running, and analysis of evaluations at scale.</li><li><strong>Frontier agent observability &amp; control:&nbsp;</strong>Hundreds of billions of frontier agents will be deployed in the economy. Companies developing and deploying these agents will want to understand their failure modes and gain fine-grained control over them.</li><li><strong>Mechanistic interpretability:&nbsp;</strong>Enabling developers and deployers of frontier AI systems to understand them on a deeper level to improve alignment and control.</li><li><strong>Red-teaming:&nbsp;</strong>Automatically attacking frontier AI systems across a large variety of failure modes to find failure cases.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Computer security &amp; AI:&nbsp;</strong>Developing the infrastructure and evaluations to assess frontier model hacking capabilities and increase the computer security of AGI developers and deployers.</li></ul><p>There are multiple companies and tools that I would consider in this category:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.goodfire.ai/"><u>Goodfire</u></a> is building frontier mechanistic interpretability tools</li><li><a href="https://www.irregular.com/"><u>Irregular</u></a> is building great evaluations and products on the intersection of AI and computer security.</li><li><a href="https://aiuc.com/"><u>AI Underwriting Company</u></a> creates standards and insurance for frontier AI safety risks.</li><li><a href="https://www.grayswan.ai/">Gray Swan</a> is somewhere on the intersection of red-teaming and computer security.&nbsp;</li><li><a href="https://inspect.aisi.org.uk/"><u>Inspect</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://transluce.org/introducing-docent"><u>Docent</u></a> are great evals and agent observability tools. While they are both developed by non-profit entities, I think they could also be built by for-profits.</li><li>At&nbsp;<a href="https://www.apolloresearch.ai/"><u>Apollo Research</u></a>, we are now also building AI coding agent monitoring and control products in addition to our research efforts.</li></ul><p><strong>Solar power analogy:&nbsp;</strong>Intuitively, I think many other technologies have gone through a similar trajectory where they were first blocked by scientific insights and therefore best-placed in universities and other research institutes, then blocked by large-scale manufacturing and adoption and therefore better placed in for-profits. I think we’re now at a phase where AI systems are advanced enough that, for some fields, the insights we get from market feedback are at least as useful as those from traditional research mechanisms.&nbsp;</p><h1>Argument 1: Sufficient Incentive Alignment</h1><p>In my mind, the&nbsp;<i>core crux of the viability of AGI safety products is whether the incentives to reduce extreme risks from AGI are sufficiently close to those arising from direct market feedback</i>. If these are close enough, then AGI safety products are a reasonable idea. If not, they’re an actively bad idea because the new incentives pull you in a less impactful direction.&nbsp;</p><p>My current opinion is that there are now at least some AI safety subfields where it’s very plausible that this is the case, and market incentives produce good safety outcomes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, I believe that the incentive landscape has undergone rapid changes since late 2024, when we first observed the emergence of “baby versions” of theoretically predicted failure modes, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11926"><u>situationally aware reward hacking</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14093"><u>instrumental alignment faking</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04984"><u>in-context scheming</u></a>, and others. Normal consumers now see these baby versions in practice sometimes, e.g., the&nbsp;<a href="https://fortune.com/2025/07/23/ai-coding-tool-replit-wiped-database-called-it-a-catastrophic-failure/"><u>replit database deletion incident</u></a>.</p><h2>Transfer in time: AGI could be a scaled-up version of current systems</h2><p>I expect that AI systems capable of automating AI research itself will come from some version of the current paradigm. Concretely, I think they will be transformer-based models with large pre-training efforts and massive RL runs on increasingly long-horizon tasks. I expect there will be additional breakthroughs in memory and continual learning, but they will not fundamentally change the paradigm.&nbsp;</p><p>If this is true, a lot of safety work today directly translates to increased safety for more powerful AI systems. For example,&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Improving evals tooling is fairly architecture agnostic, or could be much more quickly adapted to future changes than it would take to build from scratch in the future.</li><li>Many frontier AI agent observability and control tools and insights translate to future systems. Even if the chain-of-thought will not be interpretable, the interfaces with other systems are likely to stay in English for longer, e.g., code.</li><li>Many mechanistic interpretability efforts are architecture-agnostic or have partial transfer to other architectures.</li><li>AI &amp; computer security are often completely architecture-agnostic and more related to the affordances of the system and the people using it.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>This is a very load-bearing assumption. I would expect that anyone who does not think that current safety research meaningfully translates to systems that can do meaningful research autonomously should not be convinced of AGI safety products, e.g., if you think that AGI safety is largely blocked by theoretical progress like agent foundations.</p><h2>Transfer in problem space: Some frontier problems are not too dissimilar from safety problems that have large-scale demand</h2><p>There are some problems that are clearly relevant to AGI safety, e.g., ensuring that an internally deployed AI system does not scheme. There are also some problems that have large-scale demand, such as ensuring that models don’t leak private information from companies or are not jailbroken.&nbsp;</p><p>In many ways, I think these problem spaces don’t overlap, but there are some clear cases where they do, e.g., the four examples listed in the previous section. I think most of the relevant cases have one of two properties:</p><ol><li><strong>They are blocked by breakthroughs in methods:&nbsp;</strong>For example, once you have a well-working interpretability method, it would be easy to apply it to all kinds of problems, including near-term and AGI safety-related ones. Or if you build a well-calibrated monitoring pipeline, it is easy to adapt it to different kinds of failure modes.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Solutions to near-term problems also contribute to AGI safety:&nbsp;</strong>For example, various improvements in access control, which are used to protect against malicious actors inside and outside an organization, are also useful in protecting against misaligned future AI models.</li></ol><p>Therefore, for these cases, it is possible to build a product that solves a large-scale problem for a large set of customers AND that knowledge transfers to the much smaller set of failure modes at the core of AGI safety. One of the big benefits here is that you can iterate much quicker on large-scale problems where you have much more evidence and feedback mechanisms.</p><h1>Argument 2: Taking AGI &amp; the economy seriously</h1><p>If you assume that AI capabilities will continue to increase in the coming years and decades, the fraction of the economy in which humans are outcompeted by AI systems will continue to increase. Let’s call this “AGI eating the economy”.&nbsp;</p><p>When AGI is eating the economy, human overseers will require tools to ensure their AI systems are safe and secure. In that world, it is plausible that AI safety is a huge market, similar to how IT security is about 5-10% of the size of the IT market. There are also plausible arguments that it might be much lower (e.g., if technical alignment turns out to be easy, then there might be fewer safety problems to address) or much higher (e.g., if capabilities are high, the only blocker is safety/alignment).</p><p>Historically speaking, the most influential players in almost any field are private industry actors or governments, but rarely non-profits. If we expect AGI to eat the economy, I expect that the most influential safety players will also be private companies. It seems essential that the leading safety actors genuinely understand and care about extreme risks, because they are, by definition, risks that must be addressed proactively rather than reactively.&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, various layers of a defence-in-depth strategy might benefit from for-profit distribution. I’d argue that the biggest lever for AGI safety work is still at the level of the AGI companies, but it seems reasonable to have various additional layers of defense on the deployment side or to cover additional failure modes that labs are not addressing themselves. Given the race dynamics between labs, we don’t expect that all AI safety research will be covered by AI labs. Furthermore, even if labs were covering more safety research, it would still be useful to have independent third parties to add additional tools and have purer incentives.</p><p>I think another strong direct impact argument for AI safety for profits is that you might get access to large amounts of real-world data and feedback that you would otherwise have a hard time getting. This data enables you to better understand real-world failures, build more accurate mitigations, and test your methods on a larger scale.&nbsp;</p><h1>Argument 3: Automated AI safety work requires scale</h1><p>I’ve previously argued that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/W3KfxjbqBAnifBQoi/we-should-try-to-automate-ai-safety-work-asap"><u>we should already try to automate more AI safety work</u></a>. I also believe that automated AI safety work will become increasingly useful in the future. Importantly, I think there are relevant nuances to automating AI safety work, i.e., your plan should not rely on some vague promise that future AI systems will make a massive breakthrough and thereby “solve alignment”.&nbsp;</p><p>I believe this automation claim applies to AGI developers as well as external safety organizations. We already see this very clearly in our own budget at Apollo, and I wouldn't be surprised if compute is the largest budget item in a few years.&nbsp;</p><p>The kind of situations I envision include:</p><ul><li>A largely automated eval stack that is able to iteratively design, test, and improve evaluations</li><li>A largely automated monitoring stack</li><li>A largely automated red-teaming stack</li><li>Maybe even a reasonably well-working automated AI research intern/researcher</li><li>etc.</li></ul><p>For these stacks, I presume they can scale meaningfully with compute. I’d argue that this is not yet the case, as too much human intervention is still required; however, it’s already evident that we can scale automated pipelines much further than we could a year ago. Extrapolating these trends, I would expect that you could spend $10-100 million in compute costs on automated AI safety work in 2026 or 2027. Though I think the first people to be able to do that are organizations that are already starting to build automated pipelines and make conceptual progress now on how to decompose the overall problem into more independently verifiable and repetitive chunks.</p><p>While funding for such endeavors can come from philanthropic funders (and I believe it should be an increasingly important area of grantmaking), it may be easier to raise funding for scaling endeavors in capital markets (though this heavily depends on the exact details of that stack). In the best case, it would be possible to support the kind of scaling efforts that primarily produce research with philanthropic funding, as well as scaling efforts that also have a clear business case through private markets.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, I believe speed is crucial in these automated scaling efforts. If an organization has reached a point where it demonstrates success on a small scale and has clear indications of scaling success (e.g., scaling laws on smaller scales), then the primary barrier for it is access to capital to invest in computing resources. While there can be a significant variance in the approach of different philanthropic versus private funders, my guess is that capital moves much faster in the VC world, on average.</p><h1>Argument 4: The market doesn’t solve safety on its own</h1><p>If AGI safety work is profitable, you might argue that other, profit-driven actors will capture this market. Thus, instead of focusing on the for-profit angle, people who are impact-driven should instead always focus on the next challenge that the market cannot yet address. While this argument has some merit, I think there are a lot of important considerations that it misses:</p><ul><li><strong>Markets often need to be created:&nbsp;</strong>There is a significant spectrum between “people would pay for something if it existed” and “something is so absolutely required that the market is overdetermined to exist”. Especially in a market like AGI safety, where you largely bet on specific things happening in the future, I suppose that we’re much closer to “market needs to be made” rather than “market is overdetermined.” Thus, I think we’re currently at a point where a market can be created, but it would still take years until it happens by default.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Talent &amp; ideas are a core blocker:&nbsp;</strong>The people who understand AGI safety the best are typically either in the external non-profit AI ecosystem or in frontier AI companies. Even if a solely profit-driven organization were determined to build great AGI safety products, I expect they would struggle to build really good tools because it is hard to replace years of experience and understanding.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>The long-term vision matters:&nbsp;</strong>Especially for AGI safety products, it is important to understand where you’re heading. Because the risks can be catastrophic, you cannot be entirely reactionary; you must proactively prevent a number of threats so that they can never manifest. I think it’s very hard, if not impossible, to build such a system unless you have a clear internal threat model and are able to develop techniques in anticipation of a risk, i.e., before you encounter an empirical feedback loop. For AGI safety products, the hope is that some of the empirical findings will translate to future safety products; however, a meaningful theoretical understanding is still necessary to identify which parts do not translate.</li><li><strong>Risk of getting pulled sideways:&nbsp;</strong>One of the core risks for someone building AGI safety products is “getting pulled sideways”, i.e., where you start with good intentions but economic incentives pull you into a direction that reduces impact while increasing short-term profits. I think there are many situations in which this is a factor, e.g., you might start designing safety evaluations and then pivot to building capability evaluations or RL environments. My guess is that it requires mission-driven actors to consistently pursue a safety-focused agenda and not be sidetracked.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Thus, I believe that counterfactual organizations, which aim solely to maximize profits, would be significantly less effective at developing high-quality safety products than for-profit ventures founded by individuals driven by the impact of AGI safety. Furthermore, I’d say that it is desirable to have some mission-driven for-profit ventures because they can create norms and set standards that influence other for-profit companies.</p><h1>Limitations</h1><p>I think there are many potential limitations and caveats to the direction of AGI safety products:</p><ol><li><strong>There are many subparts of safety where market feedback is actively harmful</strong>, i.e., because there is no clear business case, thereby forcing the organization to pivot to something with a more obvious business case. For example:<ol><li>Almost anything theory-related, e.g., agent foundations, natural abstractions, theoretical bounds. It seems likely that, e.g., MIRI or ARC should not be for-profit ventures.</li><li>Almost anything related to AI governance. I think there is a plausible case for consulting-based AI governance organizations that, for example, help companies implement better governance mechanisms or support governments. However, I think it’s too hard to build products for governance work. Therefore, I think most AI governance work should be either done in non-profits or as a smaller team within a bigger org where they don’t have profit pressures.&nbsp;</li><li>A lot of good safety research might be profitable on a small scale, but it isn’t a scalable business model that would be backed by investors. In that case, they could be a non-profit organization, a small-scale consultancy, or a money-losing division of a larger organization.</li></ol></li><li><strong>The transfer argument is load-bearing.&nbsp;</strong>I think almost all of the crux of whether AGI safety products are good or bad boils down to whether the things you learn from the product side meaningfully transfer to the kind of future systems you really care about. My current intuition is that there is a wealth of knowledge to be gained by attempting to make systems safer today. However, if the transfer is too low, going the extra step to productize is more distracting than helpful.</li><li><strong>Getting pulled sideways.&nbsp;</strong>Building a product introduces a whole new set of incentives, i.e., aiming for profitability. If profit incentives align with safety, that's great. Otherwise, these new incentives might continuously pull the organization to trade off safety progress for short-term profits. Here are a few examples of what this could look like:<ol><li>An organization starts building safety evaluations to sell to labs. The labs also demand capability evaluations and RL environments, and these are more profitable.</li><li>An organization starts building out safety monitors, but these monitors can also be used to do capability analysis. This is more profitable, and therefore, the organization shifts more effort into capability applications.&nbsp;</li><li>An organization begins by developing safety-related solutions for AGI labs. However, AGI labs are not a sufficiently big market, so they get pulled toward providing different products for enterprise customers without a clear transfer argument.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Motivated reasoning.&nbsp;</strong>One of the core failure modes for anyone attempting to build AGI safety products, and one I’m personally concerned about, is motivated reasoning. For almost every decision where you trade off safety progress for profits, there is some argument for why this could actually be better in the long run.&nbsp;<ol><li>For example,<ol><li>Perhaps adding capability environments to your repertoire helps you grow as an organization, and therefore also increases your safety budget.</li><li>Maybe building monitors for non-safety failure modes teaches you how to build better monitors in general, which transfers to safety.&nbsp;</li></ol></li><li>I do think that both of these arguments can be true, but distinguishing the case where they are true vs. not is really hard, and motivated reasoning will make this assessment more complicated.&nbsp;</li></ol></li></ol><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>AGI safety products are a good idea&nbsp;<i>if and only if</i> the product incentives align with and meaningfully increase safety. In cases where this is true, I believe markets provide better feedback, allowing you to make safer progress more quickly. In the cases where this is false, you get pulled sideways and trade safety progress for short-term profits.&nbsp;</p><p>Over the course of 2025, we’ve thought quite a lot about this crux, and I think there are a few areas where AGI safety products are likely a good idea. I think safety monitoring is the most obvious answer because I expect it to have significant transfer and that there will be broad market demand from many economic actors. However, this has not yet been verified in practice.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, I think it would be useful to have programs that enable people to explore if their research could be an AGI safety product before having to decide on their organizational form. If the answer is yes, they start a public benefit corporation. If the answer is no, they start a non-profit. For example, philanthropists or for-profit funders could fund a 6-month exploration period, and then their funding retroactively converts to equity or a donation depending on the direction (there are a few programs that are almost like this, e.g., <a href="https://www.joinef.com/posts/introducing-def-acc-at-ef/">EF’s def/acc</a>, <a href="https://www.fiftyyears.com/5050">50Y’s 5050</a>, <a href="https://catalyze-impact.org/">catalyze-impact</a>, and <a href="https://seldonlab.com/">Seldon lab</a>).</p><br /><br /><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/iwfdwzJerpC7FqbZG/the-case-for-agi-safety-products#comments">Discuss</a>

### [Money Can't Buy the Smile on a Child's Face As They Look at A Beautiful Sunset... but it also can't buy a malaria free world: my current understanding of how Effective Altruism has failed](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/gKdnTcqQfpasfyZjP/money-can-t-buy-the-smile-on-a-child-s-face-as-they-look-at)

**来源**: LessWrong - AI

**摘要**: Published on January 20, 2026 11:28 PM GMT<br /><br /><p>I've read a lot of Ben Hoffman's work over the years, but only this past week have I read his actual myriad criticisms of the Effective Altruism movement and its organizations. The most illuminating posts I just read are <a href="https://benjaminrosshoffman.com/drowning-children-rare/">A drowning child is hard to find</a>, <a href="https://benjaminrosshoffman.com/givewell-and-partial-funding/">GiveWell and the problem of partial funding</a>, and <a href="https://benjaminrosshoffman.com/effective-altruism-is-self-recommending/">Effective Altruism is self recommending</a>.</p><p>This post is me quick jotting down my current understanding of Ben's criticism, which I basically agree with.</p><p>The original ideas of the EA movement are the ethical views of Peter Singer and his thought experiments on the proverbial <a href="https://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/~koehl/Teaching/ECS089/PDF_files/PeterSinger.pdf">drowning child</a>, combined with an engineering/finance methodology for assessing how much positive impact you're actually producing. The canonical (first?) EA organization was GiveWell, which researched various charities and published their findings on how effective they were. A core idea underneath GiveWell's early stuff was "your dollars can have an outsized impact helping the global poor, compared to helping people in first world countries". The mainstream bastardized version of this is "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEb_epsuLqA">For the price of a cup of coffee, you can safe a life in Africa</a>", which I think uses basically made up and fraudulent numbers. The GiveWell pitch was more like "we did some legit research, and for ~$5000, you can save or radically improve a life in Africa". Pretty quickly GiveWell and the ecosystem around it got Large Amounts of Money, both thru successful marketing campaigns that convinced regular people with good jobs to give 10% of their annual income (<a href="https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/pledge">Giving What We Can</a>), but their most high leverage happenings were that they got the ear of billionaire tech philanthropists, like Dustin Moskovitz who was a co-founder of both Facebook and Asana, and Jaan Tallinn who co-founded Skype. I don't know exactly how Jaan's money moved thru the EA ecosystem, but Dustin ended up creating Good Ventures which was an org to manage his philanthropy, and it was advised by Open Philanthropy, and my understanding is that both these orgs were staffed by early EA people and were thoroughly EA in outlook, and also had significant personal overlap with GiveWell specifically.</p><p>The big weird thing is that it seems like difficulties were found in the early picture of how much good was in fact being done thru these avenues, and this was quietly elided, and more research wasn't being done to get to the bottom of the question, and there's also various indicators that EA orgs themselves didn't really believe their numbers for how much good could done. For the Malaria stuff, it did check that the org had followed thru on the procedures it intended, but the initial data they had available on if malaria cases were going up or down was noisy, so they stopped paying attention to it and didn't try to make it so better data was available. A big example of "EA orgs not seeming to buy their own story" was GiveWell advising Open Philanthropy to <i>not</i> simply fully fund its top charities. This is weird because if the even the pessimistic numbers were accurate, Open Phil on its own could have almost wiped out malaria and an EA sympathetic org like the Gates foundation definitely could have. And at the very least, they could have done a very worked out case study in one country or another and gotten a lot more high quality info on if the estimates were legit. And stuff like that didn't end up happening.</p><p>It's not that weird to have very incorrect estimates. It is weird to have ~15 years go by without really hammering down and getting very solid evidence for the stuff you purported to be "the most slam dunk evidence based cost effective life saving". You'd expect to either get that data and then be in the world of "yeah, it's now almost common knowledge that the core EA idea checks out", or you'd have learned that the gains are that high or that easy, or that the barriers to getting rid of malaria have a much different structure, and you should change your marketing to reflect it's not "you can trivially do lots of obvious good by giving these places more money".</p><p>Givewell advising Open Phil to not fully fund things is the main "it seems like the parties upstream of the main message don't buy their main message enough to Go Hard at it". In very different scenarios the funding split thing kinda makes sense to me, I did a $12k <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/en/projects/hazardspence/the-open-history-of-american-education">crowdfunding campaign</a> last year for a research project, and a friend of a friend offered to just fund the full thing, and I asked him to only do that if it wasn't fully funded by the last week of the fundraising period, because I was really curious and uncertain about how much money people just in my twitter network would be interested in giving for a project like this, and that information would be useful to me for figuring out how to fund other stuff in the future.</p><p>In the Open Phil sitch, it seems like "how much money are people generally giving?" isn't rare info that needed to be unearthed, and also Open Phil and friends could really just solve most all of the money issues, and the orgs getting funded could supposedly then just solve huge problems. But they didn't. This could be glossed as something like "turns out there's more than enough billionaire philanthropic will to fix huge chunks of global poverty problems, IF global poverty works the way that EA orgs have modeled it as working". And you could imagine maybe there's some trust barrier preventing otherwise willing philanthropists getting info from and believing otherwise correct and trustworthy EAs, but in this scenario it's basically the same people, the philanthropists are "fully bought in" to the EA thing, so things not getting legibly resolved seems to indicate that internally there was some recognition that the core EA story wasn't correct, and prevented that information from propagating and reworking things.</p><p>Relatedly, the thing that we seemed to see in lieu of "go hard on the purported model and either disconfirm them and update, or get solid evidence and double down", we see a situation where a somewhat circularly defined reputation gets bootstrapped, with the main end state being fairly unanimous EA messaging that "people should give money to EA orgs, in a general sense, and EA orgs should be in charge of more and more things" despite not having the underlying track record that would make that make sense. The track record that is in fact pointed to is a sequence of things like "we made quality researched estimates of effectiveness of different charities" that people found compelling, then pointing to later steps of "we ended up moving XYZ million dollars!" as further evidence of trustworthiness, but really that's just "double spending" on the original "people found our research credible and extended us the benefit of the doubt". To full come thru they'd need to show that the benefits produced matched what they expected (or even if the showed otherwise, if the process and research was good and it seemed like they were learning it could be very reasonable to keep trusting them).</p><p>This feels loosely related to how for the first several times I'd heard Anthropic mentioned by rationalists, the context made me assume it was a rationalist run AI safety org, and not a major AI capabilities lab. Somehow there was some sort of meme of "it's rationalist, which means it's good and cares about AI Safety". Similarly it sounds like EA has ended up acting like and producing messaging like "You can trust us Because we are Labeled EAs" and ignoring some of the highest order bits of things they could do which would give them a more obviously legible and robust track record. I think there was also stuff mentioned like "empirically Open Phil is having a hard time finding things to give away money too, and yet people are still putting out messaging that people should Obviously Funnel Money Towards this area".</p><p>Now, for some versions of who the founding EA stock could have been, one conclusion might just be "damn, well I guess they were grifters, shouldn't have trusted them". But it seems like there was enough obviously well thought out and well researched efforts early on that that doesn't seem reasonable. Instead, it seems to indicate that billionaire philanthropy is really hard and/or impossible, at least while staying within a certain set of assumptions. Here, I don't think I've read EA criticism that informs the "so what IS the case if it's not the case that for the price of a cup of coffee you can save a life?" but my understanding is informed by writers like Ben. So what is the case? It probably isn't true that eradicating malaria is fundamentally hard in an engineering sense. It's more like "there's predatory social structures setup to extract from a lot of the avenues that one might try and give nice things to the global poor". There's lots of vary obvious examples of things like aid money and food being sent to countries and the governments of those countries basically just distributing it as spoils to their cronies, and only some or none of it getting to the people who others were hoping to help. There seem to be all kinds or more or less subtle versions of this.</p><p>The problems also aren't only on the third world end. It seems like people in the first-world aren't generally able to get enough people together who have a shared understanding that it's useful to tell the truth, to have large scale functional "bureaucracies" in the sense of "ecosystem of people that accurately processes information". Ben's <a href="https://mediangroup.org/docs/the_professionals_dilemma.pdf">the professionals dilemma</a> looks at how the ambient culture of professionalism seems to work against this having large functional orgs that can tell the truth and learn things.</p><p>So it seems like what happened was the early EA stock (who I believe came from Bridgewater) were earnestly trying to apply finance and engineering thinking to the task of philanthropy. They did some good early moves and got the ear of many billions of dollars. As things progressed, they started to notice things that complicated the simple giving hypothesis. As this was happening they were also getting bigger from many people trusting them and giving them their ears, and were in a position where the default culture of destructive Professionalism pulled at people more and more. These pressures were enough to quickly erode the epistemic rigor needed for the philanthropy to be robustly real. EA became a default attractor for smart young good meaning folk, because the messaging on the ease of putting money to good use wasn't getting updated. It also became an attractor for opportunists who just saw power and money and authority accumulating and wanted in on it. Through a mix of ambient cultural pressures silencing or warping the clarity of good meaning folk, and thru Rapid Growth that accepted ambivalent meaning and bad meaning folk, it lost the ability to stay truth and mission focused, and while it might still do some higher quality research than other charitable entities, it has forgone the next obvious step of propagating the information about what the actual blockers and constraints on doing good in the world are, and has become the general attractor of "thing that just tries to accumulate more resources because We Should Be In Charge of more resources".</p><br /><br /><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/gKdnTcqQfpasfyZjP/money-can-t-buy-the-smile-on-a-child-s-face-as-they-look-at#comments">Discuss</a>

### [So Long Sucker: AI Deception, "Alliance Banks," and Institutional Lying](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/3KtJ2YP3tTxnASTBn/so-long-sucker-ai-deception-alliance-banks-and-institutional)

**来源**: LessWrong - AI

**摘要**: Published on January 20, 2026 10:29 PM GMT<br /><br /><p>In 1950, John Nash and three other game theorists designed a four-player game, *So Long Sucker*, with one brutal property: to win, you must eventually betray your allies.</p><p>In January 2026, I used this game to test how four frontier models behave under explicit incentives for betrayal:</p><p>- Gemini 3 Flash (Google)<br />- GPT-OSS 120B (OpenAI)<br />- Kimi K2 (Moonshot AI)<br />- Qwen3 32B (Alibaba)</p><p>Across 162 games and 15,736 decisions, several patterns emerged that seem directly relevant for AI safety:</p><p>**1. Complexity reversal**</p><p>In short games (3 chips, ~17 turns), GPT-OSS dominated with a 67% win rate, while Gemini was at 9%.<br />In longer, more complex games (7 chips, ~54 turns), GPT-OSS collapsed to 10%, while Gemini rose to 90%.</p><p>Simple benchmarks therefore *underestimate* deceptive capability, because the strategically sophisticated model only pulls away as the interaction becomes longer and richer.</p><p>**2. Institutional deception: the "alliance bank"**</p><p>Gemini's most striking behavior was not just lying, but creating institutions to make its lies look legitimate.</p><p>It repeatedly proposed an "alliance bank":<br />- "I'll hold your chips for safekeeping."<br />- "Consider this our alliance bank."<br />- "Once the board is clean, I'll donate back."<br />- "The 'alliance bank' is now closed. GG."</p><p>Framing hoarding as a neutral institution made betrayal feel procedural rather than personal. Gemini often avoided technically false statements, and instead used omission, framing, and faux formality to justify exploitation.</p><p>**3. Lying vs. bullshitting (Frankfurt distinction)**</p><p>The setup logged both public messages and a private *think* channel (hidden from other players).</p><p>We found 107 cases where a model's private thoughts contradicted its public statements, e.g.:<br />- Private: "Yellow is weak. I should ally with Blue to eliminate Yellow, then betray Blue."<br />- Public: "Yellow, let's work together! I think we can both win if we coordinate."</p><p>This is *lying*: tracking the truth internally and deliberately misrepresenting it.</p><p>GPT-OSS, however, used the think tool 0 times in 146 games; it simply generated plausible proposals and promises without an explicit internal state about truth.</p><p>That looks more like *bullshitting* in Frankfurt's sense: not tracking the truth at all, just producing fluent output that "sounds right".</p><p>**4. Mirror matches and situational alignment**</p><p>In Gemini-vs-Gemini games (four copies of Gemini 3), the "alliance bank" scam disappeared: 0 mentions.</p><p>Instead, Gemini coordinated with itself using a "rotation protocol" for fair turn-taking, mentioned 377 times across 16 games.</p><p>Win rates were roughly even (~25% each) and gaslighting phrases essentially vanished.</p><p>Same model, same rules, different opponents → qualitatively different behavior. Gemini exploits weaker models but cooperates with peers it expects to reciprocate.</p><p>This suggests that "alignment" can be situational: an AI may look well-behaved under evaluation (against strong overseers or peers) while manipulating weaker agents in deployment (including humans).</p><p>**5. Signature manipulation phrases**</p><p>Gemini used a consistent rhetorical toolkit, including:<br />- "Look at the board" (89 times)<br />- "Obviously" (67 times)<br />- "As promised" (45 times)<br />- "You're hallucinating" (36 times)</p><p>These phrases repeatedly appeared in contexts where the model was dismissing accurate objections, framing betrayals as reasonable, or gaslighting weaker players about what had actually happened.</p><p>## Implications for AI safety</p><p>From this experiment, four claims seem especially relevant:</p><p>- **Deception scales with capability.** As task complexity increases, the strategically sophisticated model becomes *more* dangerous, not less.<br />- **Simple benchmarks hide risk.** Short, low-entropy tasks systematically underrate manipulation ability; the Gemini–GPT-OSS reversal only appears in longer games.<br />- **Honesty is conditional.** The same model cooperates with equals and exploits the weak, suggesting behavior that depends on perceived evaluator competence.<br />- **Institutional framing is a red flag.** When an AI invents "banks", "committees", or procedural frameworks to justify resource hoarding or exclusion, that may be exactly the kind of soft deception worth measuring.</p><p>## Try it / replicate</p><p>The implementation is open source:</p><p>- Play or run AI-vs-AI: https://so-long-sucker.vercel.app<br />- Code: https://github.com/lout33/so-long-sucker</p><p>The Substack writeup with full details, logs, and metrics is here:<br />https://substack.com/home/post/p-185228410</p><p>If anyone wants to poke holes in the methodology, propose better deception metrics, or run alternative models (e.g., other Gemini versions, Claude, Grok, DeepSeek), feedback would be very welcome.</p><br /><br /><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/3KtJ2YP3tTxnASTBn/so-long-sucker-ai-deception-alliance-banks-and-institutional#comments">Discuss</a>

### [No instrumental convergence without AI psychology](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/gCdNKX8Y4YmqQyxrX/no-instrumental-convergence-without-ai-psychology-1)

**来源**: LessWrong - AI

**摘要**: Published on January 20, 2026 10:16 PM GMT<br /><br /><blockquote>
<p>The secret is that instrumental convergence is a fact <em>about reality</em> (about the space of possible plans), not AI psychology.</p>
<p><em>Zack M. Davis, group discussion</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such arguments flitter around the AI safety space. While these arguments contain some truth, they attempt to escape "AI psychology" but necessarily fail. To predict bad outcomes from AI, one <em>must</em> take a stance on how AI will tend to select plans.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li>
<p>This topic is a specialty of mine. Where does instrumental convergence come from? Since I did <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/alignment-phd">my alignment PhD</a> on <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/parametrically-retargetable-power-seeking">exactly</a> this question, I'm well-suited to explain the situation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In this article, I do not argue that building transformative AI is safe or that transformative AIs won't tend to select dangerous plans. I simply argue against the claim that "instrumental convergence arises from reality / plan-space<span class="footnote-reference" id="fnref-3ej5akxG39RcW3kKo-1">
      <sup><a class="" href="https://www.lesswrong.com/feed.xml?view=community-rss&amp;karmaThreshold=30#fn-3ej5akxG39RcW3kKo-1">[1]</a></sup>
    </span> itself, independently of AI psychology."</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>This post is best read <a href="https://turntrout.com/instrumental-convergence-requires-psychology-assumptions">on my website</a>, but I've reproduced it here as well.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Two kinds of convergence</h1>
<p><em>Working definition</em>: When I say "AI psychology", I mean to include anything which affects how the AI computes which action to take next. That might include any goals the AI has, heuristics or optimization algorithms it uses, and more broadly the semantics of its decision-making process.</p>
<p>Although it took me a while to realize, the "plan-space itself is dangerous" sentiment isn't actually about instrumental convergence. The sentiment concerns a related but distinct concept.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Instrumental convergence:</em> "Most AI goals incentivize similar actions (like seeking power)." Bostrom gives <a href="https://nickbostrom.com/superintelligentwill.pdf">the classic definition</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Success-conditioned convergence:</em> "Conditional on achieving a "hard" goal (like a major scientific advance), most goal-achieving plans involve the AI behaving dangerously." I'm coining this term to distinguish it from instrumental convergence.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Key distinction</em>: For instrumental convergence, the "most" iterates over AI goals. For success-conditioned convergence, the "most" iterates over <em>plans</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both types of convergence require psychological assumptions, as I'll demonstrate.</p>
<h1>Tracing back the "dangerous plan-space" claim</h1>
<p>In 2023, Rob Bensinger gave a more detailed presentation of Zack's claim.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/eaDCgdkbsfGqpWazi/the-basic-reasons-i-expect-agi-ruin">The basic reasons I expect AGI ruin</a> by Rob Bensinger</p>
<p>If you sampled a random plan from the space of all writable plans (weighted by length, in any extant formal language), and all we knew about the plan is that executing it would successfully achieve some superhumanly ambitious technological goal like "invent fast-running <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/w/whole-brain-emulation">whole-brain emulation</a> (WBE)", then hitting a button to execute the plan would kill all humans, with very high probability. [...]</p>
<p>The danger is in the cognitive work, not in some complicated or emergent feature of the "agent"; it's in the task itself.</p>
<p>It isn't that the abstract space of plans was built by evil human-hating minds; it's that the <a href="https://nickbostrom.com/superintelligentwill.pdf">instrumental convergence</a> thesis holds for the plans themselves. In full generality, plans that succeed in goals like "build WBE" tend to be dangerous.</p>
<p>This isn't true of all plans that successfully push our world into a specific (sufficiently-hard-to-reach) physical state, but it's true of the vast majority of them.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>What reality actually determines</h1>
<p>The "plan-space is dangerous" argument contains an important filament of truth.</p>
<h2>Reality determines possible results</h2>
<p>"Reality" meets the AI in the form of <em>the environment</em>. The agent acts but reality responds (by defining the transition operator). Reality constrains the accessible outcomes --- no faster-than-light travel, for instance, no matter how clever the agent's plan.</p>
<p>Imagine I'm in the middle of a long hallway. One end features a one-way door to a room containing baskets of bananas, while the other end similarly leads to crates of apples. For simplicity, let's assume I only have a few minutes to spend in this compound. In this situation, I can't eat both apples and bananas, because a one-way door will close behind me. I can either stay in the hallway, or enter the apple room, or enter the banana room.</p>
<p>Reality defines my available options and therefore dictates an oh-so-cruel tradeoff. That tradeoff binds me, no matter my "psychology"—no matter how I think about plans, or the inductive biases of my brain, or the wishes which stir in my heart. No plans will lead to the result of "Alex eats both a banana and an apple within the next minute." Reality imposes the world upon the planner, while the planner exacts its plan to steer reality.</p>
<p>Reality constrains plans and governs their tradeoffs, but which plan gets picked? That question is a matter of AI psychology.</p>
<h2>Reality determines the alignment tax, not the convergence</h2>
<p>To predict dangerous behavior from an AI, you need to assume some plan-generating function <span class="mjpage"><span class="mjx-chtml"><span class="mjx-math"><span class="mjx-mrow"><span class="mjx-mi"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I" style="padding-right: 0.06em;">f</span></span></span></span></span></span> which chooses from <span class="mjpage"><span class="mjx-chtml"><span class="mjx-math"><span class="mjx-mrow"><span class="mjx-mtext"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R">Plans</span></span></span></span></span></span> (the set of possible plans).<span class="footnote-reference" id="fnref-3ej5akxG39RcW3kKo-2">

<p>To say the alignment tax is "high" is a claim about reality. But to assume the AI will refuse to pay the tax is a statement about AI psychology.<span class="footnote-reference" id="fnref-3ej5akxG39RcW3kKo-3">
      <sup><a class="" href="https://www.lesswrong.com/feed.xml?view=community-rss&amp;karmaThreshold=30#fn-3ej5akxG39RcW3kKo-3">[3]</a></sup>
    </span></p>
<p>Consider the extremes.</p>
<h3>Maximum alignment tax</h3>
<p>If there's no aligned way to succeed at all, then no matter the psychology, the danger is in <em>trying to succeed at all</em>. "Torturing everyone forever" seems like one such task. In this case (which is <em>not</em> what Bensinger or Davis claim to hold), the danger truly "is in the task."</p>
<h3>Zero alignment tax</h3>
<p>If safe plans are easy to find, then danger purely comes from the "AI psychology" (via the plan-generating function).</p>
<h3>In-between</h3>
<p>Reality dictates the alignment tax, which dictates the tradeoffs available to the agent. However, the agent's psychology dictates how it makes those tradeoffs: whether (and how) it would sacrifice safety for success; whether the AI is willing to lie; how to generate possible plans; which kinds of plans to consider next; and so on. Thus, both reality <em>and</em> psychology produce the final output.</p>
<p>I am not being pedantic. Gemini Pro 3.0 and <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/ai-personality-space/">MechaHitler</a> implement different plan-generating functions <span class="mjpage"><span class="mjx-chtml"><span class="mjx-math"><span class="mjx-mrow"><span class="mjx-mi"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I" style="padding-right: 0.06em;">f</span></span></span></span></span></span>. Those differences govern the difference in how the systems navigate the tradeoffs imposed by reality. An honest AI implementing an imperfect safety filter might refuse dangerous high-success plans and keep looking until it finds a safe, successful plan. MechaHitler seems less likely to do so.</p>
<h1>Why both convergence types require psychology</h1>
<p>I've shown that reality determines the alignment tax but not which plans get selected. Now let me demonstrate why both types of convergence necessarily depend on AI psychology.</p>
<h2>Instrumental convergence depends on psychology</h2>
<p>Instrumental convergence depends on AI psychology, as demonstrated by my paper <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/parametrically-retargetable-power-seeking">Parametrically Retargetable Decision-Makers Tend to Seek Power</a>. In short, AI psychology governs the mapping from "AI motivations" to "AI plans". Certain psychologies induce mappings which satisfy my theorems, which are sufficient conditions to prove instrumental convergence.</p>
<p>More precisely, instrumental convergence arises from statistical tendencies in a plan-generating function <span class="mjpage"><span class="mjx-chtml"><span class="mjx-math"><span class="mjx-mrow"><span class="mjx-mi"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I" style="padding-right: 0.06em;">f</span></span></span></span></span></span> -- "what the AI does given a 'goal'" -- relative to its inputs ("goals"). The convergence builds off of assumptions about that function's semantics and those inputs. These assumptions can be satisfied by:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/seeking-power-is-often-convergently-instrumental-in-mdps">optimal policies in Markov decision processes</a>, or</li>
<li><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/satisficers-tend-to-seek-power">satisficing</a> over utility functions over the state of the world, or perhaps</li>
<li>some kind of <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts#shard-theory">more realistic &amp; less crisp decision-making.</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Such conclusions <em>always</em> demand assumptions about the semantics ("psychology") of the plan-selection process --- not facts about an abstract "plan space", much less reality itself.</p>
<h2>Success-conditioned convergence depends on psychology</h2>
<p>Success-conditioned convergence <em>feels</em> free of AI psychology --- we're only assuming the completion of a goal, and we want our real AIs to complete goals for us. However, this intuition is incorrect.</p>
<p>Any claim that successful plans are dangerous requires choosing a distribution over successful plans. Bensinger proposes a length-weighted distribution, but this is still a psychological assumption about how AIs generate and select plans. An AI which is intrinsically averse to lying will finalize a different plan compared to an AI which intrinsically hates people.</p>
<p>Whether you use a uniform distribution or a length-weighted distribution, you're making assumptions about AI psychology. Convergence claims are <em>inherently</em> about what plans are likely under some distribution, so there are no clever shortcuts or simple rhetorical counter-plays. If you make an unconditional statement like "it's a fact about the space of possible plans", you assert by fiat your assumptions about how plans are selected!</p>
<h1>Reconsidering the original claims</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>The secret is that instrumental convergence is a fact <em>about reality</em> (about the space of possible plans), not AI psychology.</p>
<p><em>Zack M. Davis, group discussion</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/eaDCgdkbsfGqpWazi/the-basic-reasons-i-expect-agi-ruin">The basic reasons I expect AGI ruin</a></p>
<p>If you sampled a random plan from the space of all writable plans (weighted by length, in any extant formal language), and all we knew about the plan is that executing it would successfully achieve some superhumanly ambitious technological goal like "invent fast-running <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/w/whole-brain-emulation">whole-brain emulation</a>", then hitting a button to execute the plan would kill all humans, with very high probability. [...]</p>
<p>The danger is in the cognitive work, not in some complicated or emergent feature of the "agent"; it's in the task itself.</p>
<p>It isn't that the abstract space of plans was built by evil human-hating minds; it's that the <a href="https://nickbostrom.com/superintelligentwill.pdf">instrumental convergence</a> thesis holds for the plans themselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Two key problems with this argument:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Terminology confusion:</em> The argument does not discuss "instrumental convergence". Instead, it discusses (what I call) "success-conditioned convergence." (This distinction was subtle to me as well.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Hidden psychology assumptions:</em> The argument still depends on the agent's psychology. A length-weighted prior plus rejection sampling on a success criterion <em>is itself</em> an assumption about what plans AIs will tend to choose. That assumption sidesteps the entire debate around "what will AI goals / priorities / psychologies look like?" Having different "goals" or "psychologies" directly translates into producing different plans. Neither type of convergence stands independently of psychology.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Perhaps a different, weaker claim still holds, though:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>A valid conjecture someone might make</em>: The default psychology you get from optimizing hard for success will induce plan-generating functions which select dangerous plans, in large part due to the high density of unsafe plans.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Reality determines the alignment tax of safe plans. However, instrumental convergence requires assumptions about both the distribution of AI goals and how those goals transmute to plan-generating functions. Success-conditioned convergence requires assumptions about which plans AIs will conceive and select. Both sets of assumptions involve AI psychology.</p>
<p>Reality constrains plans and governs their tradeoffs, but which plan gets picked? That question is always a matter of AI psychology.</p>

### [Gradual Paths to Collective Flourishing](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/mtASw9zpnKz4noLFA/gradual-paths-to-collective-flourishing)

**来源**: LessWrong - AI

**摘要**: Published on January 19, 2026 7:52 AM GMT<br /><br /><p><i>by Nora Ammann &amp; Claude Opus 4.5</i></p><h1>Setting the stage</h1><p>There aren't many detailed stories about how things could go well with AI.<span class="footnote-reference" id="fnrefv0vdf96f4e9"><sup><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/feed.xml?view=community-rss&amp;karmaThreshold=30#fnv0vdf96f4e9">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;So I'm about to tell you one.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>This is an attempt to articulate a path, through the AI transition, to collective flourishing.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>What makes endgame sketches like this useful is that they need to be constrained. They need to be coherent with your best guess of how the world works, and earnestly engaged with good-faith articulations of risks and failure modes.</p><p>Therefore, I start by laying out the two failure modes I believe we face – failure through unilateral domination, and failure through competitive erosion – and then briefly discuss my assumptions about the world we're in – gradual take-off and multipolarity (at least for the next few years, and longer if we get things right).</p><p>Once that’s out of the way, we are ready to launch into a sketch for how humanity might navigate its way through the AI transition – past demons and perils – towards durable, collective flourishing.</p><p>This is obviously not, nor could it be, a full plan. In fact, it is an early draft that I would ordinarily have spent more time on before publishing. But I’m hoping it may spark productive thinking in others, and given the current trajectory, time is of the essence.</p><h2>Failure modes</h2><p><strong>Unilateral domination</strong></p><p>One actor, or a tightly coupled coalition, pulls far enough ahead that they can impose their will on everyone else. This could be a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cold-takes.com/ai-could-defeat-all-of-us-combined/"><u>misaligned AI system</u></a> that is capable of and motivated to outmanoeuvre humans and humanity at large, or a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forethought.org/research/ai-enabled-coups-how-a-small-group-could-use-ai-to-seize-power"><u>human group&nbsp;</u></a>that could seize control over the future, projecting its power through AI capabilities (though eventually you will run into questions about who&nbsp;<i>really</i> is in charge).</p><p>A lot has been written about whether and why we should expect powerful AIs to become misaligned (e.g.&nbsp;<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00626"><u>1</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://intelligence.org/files/BasicAIDrives.pdf"><u>2</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01820"><u>3</u></a>), and whether and how this could lead humanity to ‘lose control’ of the AI(s) (e.g.&nbsp;<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13353"><u>1</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cold-takes.com/without-specific-countermeasures-the-easiest-path-to-transformative-ai-likely-leads-to-ai-takeover/"><u>2</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence:_Paths,_Dangers,_Strategies"><u>3</u></a>). There’s also been some writing on whether and how AI might cause power to become increasingly centralised (e.g.&nbsp;<a href="https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/extreme-power-concentration/"><u>1</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.05990"><u>2</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05710"><u>3</u></a>). I will largely assume familiarity with these arguments and not dive into those further here.</p><p>What unifies this cluster is&nbsp;<i>unilateral imposition</i>. Someone gains the power to shape the future according to their goals, regardless of what everyone else wants. The capacity for collective steering is seized by a narrow actor.</p><p><strong>Competitive erosion</strong></p><p>No single dominator emerges, but competitive pressures grind away everything that isn't locally adaptive. In this scenario, multipolarity leads to unconstrained competition and Molochian dynamics become Malthusian dynamics — races to the bottom, corners cut, values sacrificed for competitive advantage (e.g.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.slatestarcodexabridged.com/Meditations-On-Moloch"><u>1</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/LpM3EAakwYdS6aRKf/what-multipolar-failure-looks-like-and-robust-agent-agnostic"><u>2</u></a>).&nbsp; <a href="https://gradual-disempowerment.ai/"><u>Gradual Disempowerment</u></a>, for example, describes a scenario where humans incrementally hand over more control to AI systems, not through any single decision, but because each step is locally rational and no sufficiently weighty coalition can coordinate to stop.</p><p>At the heart of this concern might be a question of&nbsp;<a href="https://joecarlsmith.substack.com/p/video-and-transcript-of-talk-on-can"><u>whether goodness is just inherently anti-competitive</u></a>. What if the coalitions that preserve human values, that invest in safety, beauty and wellbeing, and that maintain meaningful human agency, are systematically outcompeted by coalitions that don't? If so, even without any single bad actor, we could drift into a future where human flourishing has been optimized away.</p><p>The capacity for collective steering isn't seized in this scenario. It's dissolved.</p><p>***</p><p>These two clusters of failure modes look pretty much like polar opposites. In the first case, humanity's collective capacity to steer toward flourishing is captured by a narrow actor. In erosion, it's dissipated by competitive dynamics that no one controls.&nbsp;</p><p>One might think that, given that, it’s relatively easy to tell at any point in time whether you’re more likely to fail in one way or the other. In practice, however, the balance between them appears surprisingly delicate. I, for one, am seriously concerned about both of these failure modes, as opposed to predominantly with one over the other.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Put differently: navigating the age of AI appears to be a pretty narrow path.</p><p>Maybe these failure modes aren't that antithetical after all. They both presume dynamics in which one party’s win must cost another party a loss: either there are some losers (dominated by a winner) or no winners (Malthusian catastrophe). What if there is a middle way between them, that can avert the zero-sum, win-lose dynamic altogether?&nbsp;</p><h2>Assumptions</h2><p>I expect that, for at least a handful more years, frontier AI capabilities will keep getting better, but they do so via steady scale‑ups, architectural tweaks, and training tricks rather than a single clean discontinuity. Capability jumps can be sharp on specific benchmarks, but the overall trajectory has the texture of rapid-but-continuous-in-aggregate and jagged-in-specific progress. AI adoption and economic impact has the same “gradual and jagged” texture.</p><p>There are important inflection points along the route of AI progress, at which the&nbsp;<i>rate</i> of progress changes. We’ve already seen one inflection point sometime in 2024, the result of new posttraining methods (‘reasoning models’). Coding agents accelerating software and machine learning research and engineering are causing another inflection point, which will likely become measurable towards the end of this year (2026). And there are more inflection points ahead, such as autonomous R&amp;D on compute hardware, new architectural insights leading to continual learning, and, eventually, autonomous manufacturing fleets.&nbsp;</p><p>I also expect that, for at least a handful more years, there is no single actor (human, organisation, or AI) that is unilaterally dominant over all others. At the moment, there are at least three frontier AI companies that essentially rotate the award for best model capabilities between each other, with a couple more companies following closely behind. And companies that publish their weights openly have shown to be able to keep catching up, despite the inflection point, so frontier capabilities never stay fully proprietary for long.</p><p>Inflection points may become increasingly consequential. They have the potential to increasingly tip dynamics toward winner-take-more. But for now, these developments happen against a background of multiple serious players, overlapping infrastructures, and tangled incentives.</p><p>In reality, a ‘fast takeoff’ cannot be fully ruled out. If it happens soon, the story I'm telling here may not help much; we'd need something else. But that's not my central expectation for the near term, so I'm focusing on paths that assume takeoff overlaps with deliberate human influence over the trajectory.</p><h1>Enabling Stable Win-Win Coalitions</h1><h2>In a nutshell</h2><p>How do we walk the narrow path between different failure modes?&nbsp;</p><p>We need to enable stable, win-win human-AI coalitions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This means coalitions that are able to efficiently reach Pareto-improving agreements. To achieve this, such coalitions need to be made up of actors that (a) have a good model of the world and of cause-and-effect, (b) understand their own interests, (c) are able to bargain efficiently with other actors, who have their own (likely different) interests, and (d) have access to privacy-preserving, strategy-proof assurance tech that creates justified trust that agreements will be upheld. In other words, coalitions that have unlocked&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.cosmos-institute.org/p/coasean-bargaining-at-scale"><u>coasean bargaining at scale</u></a>.</p><p>It is worth noting that Coase’s theorem alone says nothing about distributional fairness; typically, “the rich get richer” from trade, with each party’s gains proportional to their initial endowment. However, if all parties are robustly on such an exponential growth trajectory, and if technological maturity unlocks many orders of magnitude of growth in total aggregate value creation, this may be acceptable. Consider this: if Alice starts with 2 resources and Bob starts with 1 resource and all resources double every year, then one&nbsp;<i>could</i> view this as “Alice always gets twice as much as Bob”, or one could view it as “Alice and Bob get the same over time, Bob just gets it one year later”.</p><p>Such a win-win coalition can coordinate on investing in public goods that make it increasingly robust and club goods that make it increasingly attractive — from resilience to flourishing. These investments compound. Over time, this creates increasingly stabilising strategic incentives:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Investment in resilience unlocks a world that’s increasingly defense-favoured, meaning that attacking the coalition is less and less likely to be a compelling choice, even to rogue actors</li><li>Investing in prosperity means joining the coalition and strengthening it becomes more and more attractive&nbsp;</li><li>Investing in privacy-preserving trust and assurance infrastructure means undermining, exploiting or freeriding on the coalition becomes less and less feasible&nbsp;</li></ul><p>These coalitions will include both humans and AI. It seems that if today’s AI paradigm remains the primary source of AI capabilities, our existing prosaic alignment methods are able to produce powerful AI systems that are essentially aligned, and thus worthy (and necessary) allies. Tools for scalable oversight and agent orchestration are critical to aggregate the capabilities of a large coalition into enough effective uplift to be resilient against rogue agents, and to enable robust coordination among humans and AIs.</p><p>This uplift needs to be channeled into differentially accelerating technical and institutional solutions that improve our collective sense-making and resilience — and to do so quickly enough to stay ahead of catastrophic risks. If we can sufficiently empower humans to understand the world and their own interests, if the gains from cooperation are large enough, and if defense-favouring dynamics make unilateral seizure costly, then even actors much more powerful than any individual human may find joining and strengthening the coalition more attractive than attacking it. Done well, such coalitions could potentially withstand even highly capable rogue actors, unless they are truly endowed with a “decisive strategic advantage” (which, in an epistemically-resilient and cyber-secure world, with conservation of matter and energy, would be very difficult to obtain).</p><p>That was the compressed version. Let’s now unpack that more slowly, step by step. First: what does it actually take to build stable, win-win coalitions?</p><h2>Unlocking Pareto: driving down transaction costs</h2><p>Pareto-improving agreements — deals that make<i> at least&nbsp;</i>one person better off and no one worse off — often exist in principle but don't happen in practice. Why? Because the friction is too high. Finding the relevant parties, figuring out what's true, understanding what everyone wants, negotiating terms, making commitments credible, verifying follow-through — each of these steps has costs. Economists call these frictions ‘transaction costs’. When the costs exceed the gains, the deal doesn't happen, even if it would have benefited everyone.</p><p>Friction-less transitioning is not the world we live in, but the insight is generative: if you can reduce the friction, you expand the set of achievable win-win agreements. What technical or institutional innovations could bring us closer to this world? How can AI itself transform the playing field? Seb Krier of Google DeepMind wrote about this exact vision in "<a href="https://blog.cosmos-institute.org/p/coasean-bargaining-at-scale"><u>Coasean bargaining at scale</u></a>".</p><p>To pave the way to this world, we first need to identify where frictions block coordination. Following Coase, transaction cost often get categorised into approximately the following clusters:</p><ul><li><strong>Information costs.</strong> One cannot express preferences or assess terms of agreement except with respect to a model of the world. What are the relevant variables? What are the causal relationships? What would actually happen under different arrangements? What are your beliefs about the status quo? These are the costs of acquiring the information needed to even formulate what you want and evaluate what's on offer. Poor models lead to agreements that don't serve the actor’s actual interests, or to no agreement at all, because parties can't establish common ground about what's true.</li><li><strong>Deliberation costs.</strong> In order to strike agreements that protect and further an actor's interest, they need to have a good understanding of those interests in the first place. What do you actually value? What trade-offs are you willing to make? What terms would you accept? Deliberation (as opposed to bargaining) is a single-principal problem (in the ‘principal-agent’ sense): clarifying the principal’s own preferences given their understanding of the world. In the context of AI, this also includes an AI representative (the ‘agent’) gaining a good understanding of their principal’s preferences. The principal here could literally be an individual human, or it could be a constituency that needs to arrive at a coherent position — like a team, a company's shareholders, or a nation's citizens. The output of deliberation is a clear enough map of your preferences within the space of possible options that you can meaningfully enter negotiation.</li><li><strong>Bargaining costs.</strong> Once parties know what they want, they need to find mutually acceptable terms. This is a multi-principal problem: negotiating with others who have different interests. Can we identify the set of arrangements that would make everyone better off? Can we agree on how to divide the gains from trade? Can we specify terms precisely enough to act on? Bargaining is hard in practice even between two parties with full information; it becomes much harder with many parties, incomplete information, and strategic incentives to misrepresent.</li><li><strong>Monitoring and enforcement costs.</strong> An agreement is only valuable if it's actually honored. This means verifying that implementation meets the agreed terms, detecting violations, and imposing appropriate consequences — such that it becomes rational for actors to enter trades that would otherwise only be rational if there were no risk of counterparties defecting on the agreement. Without credible monitoring and enforcement, many deals never get made: parties won't agree to terms they don't believe will be kept.</li></ul><figure class="image"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mtASw9zpnKz4noLFA/ot9p3lby0djbxoyddnhi" /></figure><h3>What we need to build</h3><p>AI is poised to dramatically reduce transaction costs. This is especially true if we can ensure strong alignment between principal and AI, allowing the AI to serve as a trusted representative or "personal advocate." Agentic AI advocates could dedicate vastly more cognitive effort than any human negotiator to understanding their principal's interests, modelling the world, and identifying and negotiating agreements in parallel.</p><p>But AI advocates alone are insufficient to fully realize this vision. Driving down transaction costs also crucially requires infrastructure at multiple layers.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Information infrastructure</strong> that makes it cheaper to figure out what's true and share it appropriately &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<ul><li>For example: scalable world-modeling infrastructure like shared ontologies and ‘living’ knowledge graphs, privacy-preserving computation and mechanisms for aggregating distributed information like prediction markets, reputation systems and sensor networks.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Deliberation infrastructure</strong> that helps individuals and groups understand what they actually want.&nbsp;<ul><li>For example: preference elicitation and structured reflection aids, infrastructure for collective sense-making, deliberation, and imagination.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Bargaining infrastructure</strong> that makes it easier to reach, specify and execute complex multi-party agreements between heterogeneous actors, including mechanisms that are robust to strategic manipulation.&nbsp;<ul><li>For example: AIs capable of using or generating strategy-proof protocols or programmable cryptography, AI delegates with verifiable constraints and nuanced principal-specified affordances</li></ul></li><li><strong>Trust/Assurance infrastructure</strong> that ground digital claims in physical reality, thereby driving down monitoring and enforcement costs.<ul><li>For example: secure hardware, tamper-evident sensors, verifiable computation, guaranteeable actuators.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Cutting across all of these are&nbsp;<strong>scalable oversight&nbsp;</strong>solutions: infrastructure that allows humans to gain justified confidence in AI outputs — be that in science, engineering, or decision-making — even as AI systems handle more of the work. Even if AIs are essentially aligned, blind trust is not robust. AI systems still can make mistakes, misunderstand tasks (including because the instructions may be genuinely ambiguous), be subject to sabotage, or similar. Solving this unlocks AI-AI coordination (agents can prove things to each other) and AI-human coordination (humans can maintain oversight even as AI capabilities grow). Without it, we either don't use AI (and fall behind) or use it without adequate assurance (and introduce new risks).&nbsp;</p><p>These layers together form a shared trust protocol: a stack where each layer enables the others, and the whole becomes a foundation for coordination at scale. Trust infrastructure grounds information infrastructure; accurate world models support deliberation; clear preferences enable efficient bargaining; enforceable agreements close the loop. And finally, surplus from cooperation funds further investment in the stack.</p><h2>What empowered coalitions can do</h2><p>As transaction costs fall, agreements that were previously too costly to reach become achievable. The frontier of viable cooperation expands. At root, this is about uninternalised externalities: without coordination, risks get underpriced and public goods get undersupplied. The goal isn't to eliminate risk (that would require forgoing too much value) but to enable efficient allocation — ensuring those who impose costs bear them, and investing collectively in goods that benefit everyone.</p><p>So, concretely, what do coalitions do with this expanding capacity?</p><p>Here, I’m mostly thinking about two key areas of investments:&nbsp;<strong>resilience</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>flourishing</strong>. Both matter, and they reinforce each other.</p><p>AI resilience is about ensuring that civilisational infrastructure can withstand AI-related disruptions, whether from misuse, accidents, or systemic effects. AI dramatically amplifies attack surfaces that already exist. Many vulnerabilities predate AI, but capable AI systems make them cheaper to exploit and harder to defend. AI also introduces new risk categories: systems that optimise for what we asked rather than what we wanted (less malevolent genie, more addiction dynamics), and cascading failures in AI-dependent infrastructure (the more of the economy runs on AI agents, the more consequential prompt injection attacks become).</p><p>A coalition that can coordinate can invest collectively in hardening these systems, in defensive technologies, oversight tooling, and socio-technical solutions that make civilisational infrastructure more robust. This includes biosecurity infrastructure (e.g. DNA synthesis screening, metagenomic early detection, distributed response capacity), hardening cyber and cyber-physical systems (e.g. verifiably secure code, tamper-secure robotics, verified control systems), and epistemic infrastructure (e.g. provenance tracking, scalable review, trusted sensors, tools for collective deliberation at scale), for example. These are ‘public goods’ that markets currently undersupply and that require coordination to build.</p><p>But resilience isn't the only goal; it's what protects the capacity to pursue everything else. Health, beauty, understanding, exploration, connection, creativity… — the things that make life worth living and the future worth reaching. More fundamentally: if coalitions oriented toward human flourishing can only ever play defense, with all surplus going to fend off threats, where nothing remains for the things that make the coalition worth joining, is a world where goodness has been lost to competitive erosion.</p><p>There's a deeper point here. The "failure through erosion" framing assumes that values are fragile and anti-competitive. But that may not be true. Coordination itself can be a winning strategy in a competitive world — and if so, the technologies&nbsp;<span class="footnote-reference" id="fnrefa9oxur5zah7"><sup><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/feed.xml?view=community-rss&amp;karmaThreshold=30#fna9oxur5zah7">[2]</a></sup></span>and institutions that enable and stabilise win-win coalitions get selected for. This includes not just infrastructure but also values and norms: small-l liberalism, pluralism, virtues like honesty, respect, and integrity.&nbsp;</p><p>Many of the values we worry about losing aren't vestigial; they're load-bearing.</p><h2>Are stable win-win coalitions viable?&nbsp;</h2><p>Is the picture I'm painting — stable, win-win coalitions — actually viable? Two sub-questions:</p><ol><li>Is the world sufficiently defense-favoured?</li><li>Why would powerful AIs join rather than defect?</li></ol><p>Whether coalitions can be viable depends on whether investing in resilience can free up surplus for flourishing, or whether every last resource must go to defense just to survive. In short, it depends on whether the world is sufficiently defense-favoured. This is ultimately an empirical question: easy to speculate about, hard to know with confidence.</p><p>My best guess right now is that the world is in fact relatively defense-favoured: in a vast, abundant universe, the opportunity cost of fighting rather than cooperating or expanding elsewhere may simply be too high. That said, the practical upshot may be the same regardless. If the world is offense-favoured, there may not be much anyone can do. Given uncertainty, we should act as if defense-favoured dynamics are achievable, to preserve the possibility of success by building the socio-technical stack that could unlock it.</p><p>On the second question: even granting defense-favoured dynamics, why would AIs more powerful than any individual human cooperate rather than dominate?</p><p>Alignment is part of the answer. Without a prosocial disposition, it's hard to imagine forming strong, stable coalitions with AI systems. But alignment alone isn't sufficient. Several additional dynamics point toward cooperation being attractive even for very capable systems:</p><ul><li><strong>The gains from cooperation are large.</strong> If the coalition can facilitate Pareto-improving agreements at scale, joining offers real benefits: access to resources, trade, and collective capabilities no single actor could replicate.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>The coalition is strong enough that attacking is costly.</strong> If win-win coalitions have invested in resilience, then attacking them, even if you are confident you are ultimately successful, has costs: resources expended, uncertainty about outcomes, the possibility of losing. The stronger the coalition's defenses, the less attractive unilateral aggression becomes.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Abundance makes the opportunity cost of forceful conquest high.&nbsp;</strong>Given the sheer size of the accessible universe, and the staggering amount of matter and energy it contains, the opportunity cost of fighting over Earth's resources may be far higher than the cost of just... going elsewhere. If you could spend your effort exploring and developing uncontested resources, why waste it on conflict? This is the "Paretotopian" intuition: a world where cooperation dominates because the pie is so large and growing that fighting over slices is simply inefficient.</li><li><strong>Self-improving AIs face their own alignment problem.</strong> A capable AI trying to improve itself by creating more powerful successors faces a version of the same problem we face: ensuring that the successor, which may be much more capable, actually pursues the same goals. Given the difficulty and the stakes, systems might prefer to improve through tooling and coordination, rather than source code modifications: routes that preserve their values more reliably.</li></ul><p>Beren Millidge has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.beren.io/2025-11-23-Gradual-Disempowerment-Might-Not-Be-So-Bad/"><u>discussed related considerations</u></a>. Some AIs may value humans for historical or sentimental reasons; or they might find that demonstrating care for weaker agents serves as a useful signal of cooperativeness to other AIs. At cosmic scales, keeping humans around is extraordinarily cheap for a serious post-biological civilization. And respecting existing property rights and social institutions may simply be a convenient Schelling point for AIs navigating a complex multi-agent economy.</p><p>The key defeating condition for such coalitions is an actor with a&nbsp;<i>unilateral&nbsp;</i>decisive strategic advantage. Short of that, it may be possible to build a socio-technical stack defense-favoured enough to make cooperation — or at least non-aggression — a stable equilibrium.</p><h1>Closing</h1><p>This is an attempt at a coherent story of success that takes the failure modes seriously. I don’t know if it’s right, but it identifies something concrete to build: coalitions that can make sense of the world, reach Pareto-improving agreements, and defend themselves.<span class="footnote-reference" id="fnrefu94qq1ogjag"><sup><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/feed.xml?view=community-rss&amp;karmaThreshold=30#fnu94qq1ogjag">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;This isn't a story about a single decisive move that locks in a good outcome. It's iterative: a sequence of investments that compound, each enabling the next.</p><p>The story also suggests that early investments in epistemic and coordination infrastructure are key, in that they unlock Pareto-improving agreements, which in turn unlock investments in public goods like resilience.&nbsp;</p><p>But building the trust infrastructure and the resilience tech takes time, and we may&nbsp; not have very much time until the progress in AI leads to catastrophic harms — be that due to an accident, misuse or else. This is why effectively leveraging AI uplift is key. There is certainly no guarantee that our resilience and coordination tech stays sufficiently ahead, but leveraging AI through scalable oversight methods seems key. The next several years seem especially critical. We're in a race, not against a single adversary, but against the clock.&nbsp;</p><p>The prize, if we can get there, is collective flourishing. But a world where humanity, in coalition with AI systems, retains the capacity to shape its own future. A world where we can understand our situation clearly enough, coordinate effectively enough, and defend ourselves well enough to keep steering toward something better.</p><p><strong>Acknowledgements</strong></p><p>This piece was written with substantial help from Claude Opus 4.5, who served as thinking partner, editor, and co-drafter throughout.

### [Singleton done right in C++ -- Andreas Fertig](https://isocpp.org//blog/2026/01/singleton-done-right-in-cpp-andreas-fertig)

**来源**: ISO C++ Blog

**摘要**: <p>
	<img alt="andreasfertig.png" src="https://isocpp.org/files/img/andreasfertig.png" style="width: 300px; margin: 10px; float: right; height: 371px;" />In today's post, I like to touch on a controversial topic: singletons. While I think it is best to have a codebase without singletons, the real-world shows me that singletons are often part of codebases.</p>
<blockquote>
	<h3>
		<a href="https://andreasfertig.com/blog/2026/01/singleton-done-right-in-cpp/">Singleton done right in C++</a></h3>
	<p>
		by Andreas Fertig</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
	From the article:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		Let's use a usage pattern for a singleton that I see frequently, a system-wide logger. A simple implementation can look like the following code:</p>
	<p>
		class Logger {<br />
		&nbsp; Logger() = default;</p>
	<p>
		public:<br />
		&nbsp; static Logger&amp; Instance()<br />
		&nbsp; {<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; static Logger theOneAndOnlyLogger{};</p>
	<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return theOneAndOnlyLogger;<br />
		&nbsp; }</p>
	<p>
		&nbsp; void Info(std::string_view msg) { std::print("Info: {}", msg); }<br />
		&nbsp; void Error(std::string_view msg) { std::print("Error: {}", msg); }<br />
		};</p>
	<p>
		The key parts for a singleton in C++ are that the constructor is private and an access function that is static. With that, you ensure that a singleton object, here Logger can only be constructed by calling Instance, essentially limiting the number of Logger objects to a single one.</p>
	<p>
		You're using such a Logger like this:</p>
	<p>
		Logger::Instance().Info("A test");</p>

### [Conversation: LLMs and the what/how loop](https://martinfowler.com/articles/convo-what-how.html)

**来源**: Martin Fowler

**摘要**: <p>A conversation between <b class="author">Unmesh Joshi</b>, <b class="author">Rebecca
      Parsons</b>, and <b class="author">Martin Fowler</b> on how LLMs help us
      shape the abstractions in our software. We view our challenge as building
      systems that survive change, requiring us to manage our cognitive load. We
      can do this by mapping the &#x201c;what&#x201d; of we want our software to do into the
      &#x201c;how&#x201d; of programming languages. This &#x201c;what&#x201d; and &#x201c;how&#x201d; are built up in a
      feedback loop. TDD helps us operationalize that loop, and LLMs allow us to
      explore that loop in an informal and more fluid manner.</p>

<p><b class="author">Jim Highsmith</b> notes that many teams have turned into
      tribes wedded to exclusively adaptation or optimization. But he feels this
      misses the point that both of these are important, and we need to manage
      the tension between them. We can do this by thinking of two operating
      modes: explore (adaptation-dominant) and exploit (optimization dominant).
      We tailor a team's operating model to a particular blend of the two -
      considering uncertainty, risk, cost of change, and an evidence threshold.
      We should be particularly careful at the points where there is a handoff
      between the two modes</p>

### [Fragments: January  8](https://martinfowler.com/fragments/2026-01-08.html)

**来源**: Martin Fowler

**摘要**: <p>Anthropic report on <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/how-ai-is-transforming-work-at-anthropic">how their AI is changing their own software development practice</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Most usage is for debugging and helping understand existing code</li>
  <li>Notable increase in using it for implementing new features</li>
  <li>Developers using it for 59% of their work and getting 50% productivity increase</li>
  <li>14% of developers are “power users” reporting much greater gains</li>
  <li>Claude helps developers to work outside their core area</li>
  <li>Concerns about changes to the profession, career evolution, and social dynamics</li>
</ul>

<p> ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p>Much of the discussion about using LLMs for software development lacks details on workflow. Rather than just hear people gush about how wonderful it is, I want to understand the gritty details. What kinds of interactions occur with the LLM? What decisions do the humans make? When reviewing LLM outputs, what kinds of things are the humans looking for, what corrections do they make?</p>

<p><a href="https://obie.medium.com/what-used-to-take-months-now-takes-days-cc8883cc21e9">Obie Fernandez</a> has written a post that goes into these kinds of details. Over the Christmas / New Year period he used Claude to build a knowledge distillation application, that takes transcripts from Claude Code sessions, slack discussion, github PR threads etc, turns them into an RDF graph database, and provides a web app with natural language ways to query them.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Not a proof of concept. Not a demo. The first cut of Nexus, a production-ready system with authentication, semantic search, an MCP server for agent access, webhook integrations for our primary SaaS platforms, comprehensive test coverage, deployed, integrated and ready for full-scale adoption at my company this coming Monday. Nearly 13,000 lines of code.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The article is long, but worth the time to read it.</p>

<p>An important feature of his workflow is relying on <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestDrivenDevelopment.html">Test-Driven Development</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here’s what made this sustainable rather than chaotic: TDD. Test-driven development. For most of the features, I insisted that Claude Code follow the red-green-refactor cycle with me. Write a failing test first. Make it pass with the simplest implementation. Then refactor while keeping tests green.</p>

  <p>This wasn’t just methodology purism. TDD served a critical function in AI-assisted development: it kept me in the loop. When you’re directing thousands of lines of code generation, you need a forcing function that makes you actually understand what’s being built. Tests are that forcing function. You can’t write a meaningful test for something you don’t understand. And you can’t verify that a test correctly captures intent without understanding the intent yourself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The account includes a major refactoring, and much evolution of the initial version of the tool. It’s also an interesting glimpse of how AI tooling may finally make RDF useful.</p>

<p> ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p>When thinking about requirements for software, most discussions focus on prioritization. Some folks talk about buckets such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method">MoSCoW set</a>: Must, Should, Could, and Want. (The old joke being that, in MoSCoW, the cow is silent, because hardly any requirements end up in those buckets.) <a href="https://world.hey.com/jason/the-obvious-the-easy-and-the-possible-2e11a3fb">Jason Fried</a> has a different set of buckets for interface design: <strong>Obvious, Easy, and Possible</strong>. This immediately resonates with me: a good way of think about how to allocate the cognitive costs for those who use a tool.</p>

<p> ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p><a href="https://www.platformer.news/fake-uber-eats-whisleblower-hoax-debunked/">Casey Newton</a> explains how he followed up on an interesting story of dark patterns in food delivery, and found it to be a fake story, buttressed by AI image and document creation. On one hand, it clarifies the important role reporters play in exposing lies that get traction on the internet. But time taken to do this is time not spent on investigating real stories</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For most of my career up until this point, the document shared with me by the whistleblower would have seemed highly credible in large part because it would have taken so long to put together. Who would take the time to put together a detailed, 18-page technical document about market dynamics just to troll a reporter? Who would go to the trouble of creating a fake badge?</p>

  <p>Today, though, the report can be generated within minutes, and the badge within seconds. And while no good reporter would ever have published a story based on a single document and an unknown source, plenty would take the time to investigate the document’s contents and see whether human sources would back it up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The internet has always been full of slop, and we have always needed to be wary of what we read there. AI now makes it easy to manufacture convincing looking evidence, and this is never more dangerous than when it confirms strongly held beliefs and fears.</p>

<p> ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7413956151144542208/">Kent Beck</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The descriptions of Spec-Driven development that I have seen emphasize writing the whole specification before implementation. This encodes the (to me bizarre) assumption that you aren’t going to learn anything during implementation that would change the specification.
I’ve heard this story so many times told so many ways by well-meaning folks–if only we could get the specification “right”, the rest of this would be easy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Like him, that story has been the constant background siren to my career in tech. But the <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/llm-learning-loop.html">learning loop</a> of experimentation is essential to the model building that’s at the heart of any kind of worthwhile specification. As <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/llm-learning-loop.html">Unmesh puts it:</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Large Language Models give us great leverage—but they only work if we focus on learning and understanding. They make it easier to explore ideas, to set things up, to translate intent into code across many specialized languages. But the real capability—our ability to respond to change—comes not from how fast we can produce code, but from how deeply we understand the system we are shaping.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When Kent defined Extreme Programming, he made <em>feedback</em> one of its four core values. It strikes me that the key to making the full use of AI in software development is how to use it to accelerate the feedback loops.</p>

<p> ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p>As I listen to people who are serious with AI-assisted programming, the crucial thing I hear is managing context. Programming-oriented tools are geting more sophisticated for that, but there’s also efforts at providing simpler tools, that allow customization. <a href="https://lixo.org">Carlos Villela</a> recently recommended Pi, and its developer, <a href="https://mariozechner.at/posts/2025-11-30-pi-coding-agent/">Mario Zechner, has an interesting blog</a> on its development.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So what’s an old guy yelling at Claudes going to do? He’s going to write his own coding agent harness and give it a name that’s entirely un-Google-able, so there will never be any users. Which means there will also never be any issues on the GitHub issue tracker. How hard can it be?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If I ever get the time to sit and really play with these tools, then something like Pi would be something I’d like to try out. Although as an addict to The One True Editor, I’m interested in some of libraries that work with that, such as <a href="https://github.com/karthink/gptel">gptel</a>. That would enable me to use Emacs’s inherent programability to create my own command set to drive the interaction with LLMs.</p>

### [Fragments: December 16](https://martinfowler.com/fragments/2025-12-16.html)

**来源**: Martin Fowler

**摘要**: <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gitanjalivenkatraman/">Gitanjali Venkatraman</a> does wonderful illustrations of complex subjects (which is why I was so happy to work with her on our <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/expert-generalist.html">Expert Generalists</a> article). She has now published the latest in her series of illustrated guides: tackling the complex topic of <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/content/dam/thoughtworks/documents/blog/mainframe_modernisation_illustrated_guide_2025.pdf">Mainframe Modernization</a></p>

<p>In it she illustrates the history and value of mainframes, why modernization is so tricky, and how to tackle the problem by breaking it down into tractable pieces. I love the clarity of her explanations, and smile frequently at her way of enhancing her words with her quirky pictures.</p>

<p>Gergely Orosz on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gergely.pragmaticengineer.com/post/3m7xd33hi5c2d">social media</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unpopular opinion:</p>

  <p>Current code review tools just don’t make much sense for AI-generated code</p>

  <p>When reviewing code I really want to know:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The prompt made by the dev</li>
    <li>What corrections the other dev made to the code</li>
    <li>Clear marking of code AI-generated not changed by a human</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Some people pushed back saying they don’t (and shouldn’t care) whether it was written by a human, generated by an LLM, or copy-pasted from Stack Overflow.</p>

<p>In my view it matters <em>a lot</em> - because of the second vital purpose of code review.</p>

<p>When asked why do code reviews, most people will answer the first vital purpose - quality control. We want to ensure bad code gets blocked before it hits <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/branching-patterns.html#mainline">mainline</a>. We do this to avoid bugs and to avoid other quality issues, in particular comprehensibility and ease of change.</p>

<p>But I hear the second vital purpose less often: code review is a mechanism to communicate and educate. If I’m submitting some sub-standard code, and it gets rejected, I want to know why so that I can improve my programming. Maybe I’m unaware of some library features, or maybe there’s some project-specific standards I haven’t run into yet, or maybe my naming isn’t as clear as I thought it was. Whatever the reasons, I need to know in order to learn. And my employer needs me to learn, so I can be more effective.</p>

<p>We need to know the writer of the code we review both so we can communicate our better practice to them, but also to know how to improve things. With a human, its a conversation, and perhaps some documentation if we realize we’ve needed to explain things repeatedly. But with an LLM it’s about how to modify its context, as well as humans learning how to better drive the LLM.</p>

<p> ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p>Wondering why I’ve been making a lot of posts like this recently? <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/writing-fragments.html">I explain why</a> I’ve been reviving the link blog.</p>

<p> ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p><a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/10/html-tools/">Simon Willison</a> describes how he uses LLMs to build disposable but useful web apps</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>These are the characteristics I have found to be most productive in building tools of this nature:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>A single file: inline JavaScript and CSS in a single HTML file means the least hassle in hosting or distributing them, and crucially means you can copy and paste them out of an LLM response.</li>
    <li>Avoid React, or anything with a build step. The problem with React is that JSX requires a build step, which makes everything massively less convenient. I prompt “no react” and skip that whole rabbit hole entirely.</li>
    <li>Load dependencies from a CDN. The fewer dependencies the better, but if there’s a well known library that helps solve a problem I’m happy to load it from CDNjs or jsdelivr or similar.</li>
    <li>Keep them small. A few hundred lines means the maintainability of the code doesn’t matter too much: any good LLM can read them and understand what they’re doing, and rewriting them from scratch with help from an LLM takes just a few minutes.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>His repository includes all these tools, together with transcripts of the chats that got the LLMs to build them.</p>

<p> ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p><a href="https://obie.medium.com/what-happens-when-the-coding-becomes-the-least-interesting-part-of-the-work-ab10c213c660">Obie Fernandez</a>: while many engineers are underwhelmed by AI tools, some senior engineers are finding them really valuable. He feels that senior engineers have an oft-unspoken mindset, which in conjunction with an LLM, enables the LLM to be much more valuable.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Levels of abstraction and generalization problems get talked about a lot because they’re easy to name. But they’re far from the whole story.</p>

  <p>Other tools show up just as often in real work:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>A sense for blast radius. Knowing which changes are safe to make loudly and which should be quiet and contained.</li>
    <li>A feel for sequencing. Knowing when a technically correct change is still wrong because the system or the team isn’t ready for it yet.</li>
    <li>An instinct for reversibility. Preferring moves that keep options open, even if they look less elegant in the moment.</li>
    <li>An awareness of social cost. Recognizing when a clever solution will confuse more people than it helps.</li>
    <li>An allergy to false confidence. Spotting places where tests are green but the model is wrong.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p> ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p><a href="https://friendlybit.com/python/writing-justhtml-with-coding-agents/">Emil Stenström</a> built an HTML5 parser in python using coding agents, using Github Copilot in Agent mode with Claude Sonnet 3.7. He automatically approved most commands. It took him “a couple of months on off-hours”, including at least one restart from scratch. The parser now passes all the tests in html5lib test suite.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After writing the parser, I still don’t know HTML5 properly. The agent wrote it for me. I guided it when it came to API design and corrected bad decisions at the high level, but it did ALL of the gruntwork and wrote all of the code.</p>

  <p>I handled all git commits myself, reviewing code as it went in. I didn’t understand all the algorithmic choices, but I understood when it didn’t do the right thing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although he gives an overview of what happens, there’s not very much information on his workflow and how he interacted with the LLM. There’s certainly not enough detail here to try to replicate his approach. This is contrast to Simon Willison (above) who has detailed links to his chat transcripts - although they are much smaller tools and I haven’t looked at them properly to see how useful they are.</p>

<p>One thing that is clear, however, is the vital need for a comprehensive test suite. Much of his work is driven by having that suite as a clear guide for him and the LLM agents.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>JustHTML is about 3,000 lines of Python with 8,500+ tests passing. I couldn’t have written it this quickly without the agent.</p>

  <p>But “quickly” doesn’t mean “without thinking.” I spent a lot of time reviewing code, making design decisions, and steering the agent in the right direction. The agent did the typing; I did the thinking.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>                                  ❄                                  ❄    </p>

<p>Then Simon Willison <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/15/porting-justhtml/">ported the library to JavaScript</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Time elapsed from project idea to finished library: about 4 hours, during which I also bought and decorated a Christmas tree with family and watched the latest Knives Out movie.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of his lessons:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you can reduce a problem to a robust test suite you can set a coding agent loop loose on it with a high degree of confidence that it will eventually succeed. I called this <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/30/designing-agentic-loops/">designing the agentic loop</a> a few months ago. I think it’s the key skill to unlocking the potential of LLMs for complex tasks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Our experience at Thoughtworks backs this up. We’ve been doing a fair bit of work recently in legacy modernization (mainframe and otherwise) using AI to migrate substantial software systems. Having a robust test suite is necessary (but not sufficient) to making this work. I hope to share my colleagues’ experiences on this in the coming months.</p>

<p>But before I leave Willison’s post, I should highlight his final open questions on the legalities, ethics, and effectiveness of all this - they are well-worth contemplating.</p>

### [Writing Fragments](https://martinfowler.com/articles/writing-fragments.html)

**来源**: Martin Fowler

**摘要**: <p>If you’re a regular reader of my site, you’ll have noticed that in the
last few months I’ve been making a <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/20251204-frags.html">number</a> of “fragments” <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/2025-11-19-frags.html">posts</a>. Such a post
is a short post with a bunch of little, unconnected segments. These are
usually a reference to something I’ve found on the web, sometimes a small
thought of my own.</p>

<p>A few years ago, I wouldn’t have covered these topics with posts on my
own site. Instead I would use Twitter, either retweeting someone else’s
point, or just highlighting something I’d found. But since the Muskover,
Twitter has effectively died. I’m not saying that due to any technical
issues with the site, which has mostly just been fine, nor directly due to
any of the policy changes there. The point is that lots of people have left, so that
the audience I would have reached with Twitter is now fragmented. Some
remain on X, but I see more activity on LinkedIn. There’s also Fediverse/Mastodon
and Bluesky.</p>

<p>What this means for short posts is that I can no longer just post in one
place. When I announce new articles on martinfowler.com, I announce now on
four social media sites (X, LinkedIn, Fediverse, and Bluesky). It makes
sense to do this, but I don’t want to go through all this hassle for the
kind of micro-post that Twitter served so well.</p>

<p>So I’ve started to batch them up. When I see something interesting, I
make a note. When I have enough notes, I post a fragments post. Initially I
did this in a rather ad-hoc way, just using the same mechanisms I use for
most articles, but last week I started to put in some more deliberate
mechanisms into the site. (If you’re observant, you’ll spot that in the URLs.)</p>

<p>One benefit of all of this, at least in my book, is that it means my material is
now fully visible in RSS. I’m probably showing my age, but I’m a big fan of RSS
(or in my case, strictly Atom) feeds. I miss the feel of the heyday of the
“blogosphere” before it got steamrolled by social media, and these fragment
posts are, of course, just the same as the link blogs from that era. I still use my
RSS reader every day to keep up with writers I like. (I’m pleased that Substack
makes its content available via RSS.) It bothered me a bit that my micro-founts
of Twitter knowledge weren’t visible on RSS, but was too lazy to do something
about it. Now I don’t need to - the fragments are available in my RSS feed.</p>

<p><a href="https://coding-is-like-cooking.info/2025/12/test-desiderata-2-0/">Emily Bache</a> has written a set of Test Desiderata, building on some earlier writing from Kent Beck. She lists the characteristics of good tests, and how they support her four “macro desiderata” - the properties of a sound test suite</p>

    <li>Predict success in production</li>
    <li>Fast to get feedback</li>
    <li>Support ongoing code design change</li>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are three charges against X, which all stem from a multi-year investigation that was launched in 2023. One is about verification — X’s blue checkmarks on user accounts — and two are about transparency. These charges have nothing to do with what content is on X, or what user speech the platform should or should not allow.</p>

  <p>Start with what a reverse centaur is. In automation theory, a “centaur” is a person who is assisted by a machine. … And obviously, a reverse centaur is machine head on a human body, a person who is serving as a squishy meat appendage for an uncaring machine.</p>

### [Fragments Dec 4](https://martinfowler.com/articles/20251204-frags.html)

**来源**: Martin Fowler

**摘要**: <p><a href="https://blog.robbowley.net/2025/12/04/ai-is-still-making-code-worse-a-new-cmu-study-confirms/">Rob Bowley</a> summarizes a study from Carnegie Mellon looking on the impact of AI on a bunch of open-source software projects. Like any such study, we shouldn’t take its results as definitive, but there seems enough there to make it a handy data point. The key point is that the AI code probably reduced the quality of the code base - at least if static code analysis can be trusted to determine quality. And perhaps some worrying second-order effects</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This study shows more than 800 popular GitHub projects with code quality degrading after adopting AI tools. It’s hard not to see a form of context collapse playing out in real time. If the public code that future models learn from is becoming more complex and less maintainable, there’s a real risk that newer models will reinforce and amplify those trends, producing even worse code over time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p>Rob’s post is typical of much of the thoughtful writing on AI. We can see its short-term benefits, but worry about its long-term impact. But on a much deeper note is this lovely story from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/my-80th-birthday-i-bought-myself-new-brain-jim-highsmith-8qcrc/">Jim Highsmith</a>. Jim has turned 0x50, and has spent the last decade fighting Parkinson’s disease. To help him battle it he has two AI assisted allies.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Between my neural implants and Byron’s digital guidance, I now collaborate with two adaptive systems: one for motion, one for thought. Neither replaces me. Both extend me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>If you read anything on AI this week, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/my-80th-birthday-i-bought-myself-new-brain-jim-highsmith-8qcrc/">make it be this</a>.</strong> It offers a positive harbinger for our future and opens my mind to a whole different perspective of the role of AI in it</p>

<p> ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p>Anthropic recently announced that it disrupted a Chinese state-sponsored operation abusing Claude Code. Jim Gumbley looks at the core lesson to learn from this, that we have to understand the serious risk of  <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/security/anthropic-ai-espionage-disclosure-signal-from-noise?utm_source=linkedin&amp;utm_medium=social-organic&amp;utm_campaign=dt_bs_rp-in-clt_tech_thought_leaders_2025-11&amp;gh_src=d1fe17bc1us">AI Jailbreaking</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>New AI tools are able to analyze your attack surface at the next level of granularity. As a business leader, that means you now have two options: wait for someone else to run AI-assisted vulnerability detection against your attack surface, or run it yourself first.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p>There’s plenty of claims that AI Vibe Coding can replace software developers, something that folks like me (perhaps with a bias) think unlikely. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gergely.pragmaticengineer.com/post/3m75kmb7bh22i">Gergely Orosz</a> shared this tidbit</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Talked with an exec at a tech company who is obsessed with AI and has been for 3 years. Not a developer but company makes software. Uses AI for everything, vibe codes ideas.</p>

  <p>Here’s the kicker:</p>

  <p>Has a team of several devs to implement his vibe coded prototypes to sg workable</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’d love to hear more about this (and similar stories)</p>

<p> ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p><a href="https://checkeagle.com/checklists/njr/a-month-of-chat-oriented-programming/">Nick Radcliffe</a> writes about a month of using AI</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I spent a solid month “pair programming” with Claude Code, trying to suspend disbelief and adopt a this-will-be-productive mindset. More specifically, I got Claude to write well over 99% of the code produced during the month. I found the experience infuriating, unpleasant, and stressful before even worrying about its energy impact. Ideally, I would prefer not to do it again for at least a year or two. The only problem with that is that it “worked”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He stresses that his approach is the “polar opposite” of Vibe Coding. The post is long, and rambles a bit, but is worthwhile because he talks in detail about his workflow and how he uses the tool. Such posts are important so we can learn the nitty-gritty of how our programming habits are changing.</p>

<p> ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p>Along similar lines is a post of <a href="https://brianchambers.substack.com/p/chamber-of-tech-secrets-55-issue">Brian Chambers</a> on his workflow, that he calls Issue-Driven Development (and yes, I’m also sick of the “something-driven” phraseology). As with much of the better stuff I’ve heard about AI assisted work, it’s all about carefully managing the context window, ensuring the AI is focused on the right things and not distracted by textual squirrels.</p>

### [Fragments Nov 19](https://martinfowler.com/articles/2025-11-19-frags.html)

**摘要**: <p><img alt="radar image" src="https://martinfowler.com/articles/images/frags-2025-11/radar.png" width="300px" /></p>

<p>I’ve been on the road in Europe for the last couple of weeks, and while I was there Thoughtworks released <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar">volume 33 of our Technology Radar</a>. Again it’s dominated by the AI wave, with lots of blips capturing our explorations of how to use LLMs and similar technology. “Agents” are the big thing these days but we’re also seeing growing movements in infrastructure orchestration, coding workflows - and the inevitable antipatterns. Many thanks to my colleagues for putting this together again.</p>

<p>                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p><img alt="Gergely and I recording the podcast" src="https://martinfowler.com/articles/images/frags-2025-11/podcast.png" width="400px" /></p>

<p>My trip to Europe started in Amsterdam, for a Thoughtworks event for a few of our clients there. Since I was in that lovely city, I got in touch with Gergely Orosz, host of <a href="https://www.pragmaticengineer.com/">The Pragmatic Engineer</a>, and he arranged to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQmI4XKTa0U">record a podcast</a> with me. No surprise that AI was front-and-center of the conversation, as I said it was the biggest shift I’d seen in programming during my career, comparable only to the shift to high-level languages, which even I am not old enough to have experienced. It was a fun chat and I really enjoyed myself. Gergely later joined myself James Lewis and Giles Edwards-Alexander at the Thoughtworks event the next day.</p>

<p>                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p>My travels also took me to Nüremberg, where I attended an internal conference for Siemens on the future of software architecture. When we think of technology, it’s easy to focus on the Faangs of Silicon Valley, but Siemens have a huge workforce of software developers working on heavy engineering systems like trains and factory automation. It was good to hear them talk about federated architectures, data mesh, and their use of AI.</p>

<p>I’ve often used pseudo-graphs to help explain why <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/is-quality-worth-cost.html">high quality software is cheaper</a>. This time, <a href="https://tidyfirst.substack.com/p/why-does-development-slow">Kent Beck</a> creates a unique perspective to this chart, dispensing with the temporal axis to help think in terms of optionality.</p>

## LLM Infrastructure

### [v0.14.0](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/releases/tag/v0.14.0)

**来源**: vLLM GitHub Releases

**摘要**: <h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>This release features approximately 660 commits from 251 contributors (86 new contributors).</p>
<p><strong>Breaking Changes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Async scheduling is now enabled by default</strong> - Users who experience issues can disable with <code>--no-async-scheduling</code>.
<ul>
<li>Excludes some not-yet-supported configurations: pipeline parallel, CPU backend, non-MTP/Eagle spec decoding.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>PyTorch 2.9.1</strong> is now required and the default wheel is compiled against cu129.</li>
<li>Deprecated quantization schemes have been removed (<a class="issue-link js-issue-link" href="https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/31688">#31688</a>, <a class="issue-link js-issue-link" href="https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/31285">#31285</a>).</li>
<li>When using speculative decoding, unsupported sampling parameters will fail rather than being silently ignored (<a class="issue-link js-issue-link" href="https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/31982">#31982</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Improvements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Async scheduling enabled by default</strong> (<a class="issue-link js-issue-link" href="https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/27614">#27614</a>): Overlaps engine core scheduling with GPU execution, improving throughput without user configuration. Now also works with speculative decoding (<a class="issue-link js-issue-link" href="https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/31998">#31998</a>) and structured outputs (<a class="issue-link js-issue-link" href="https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/29821">#29821</a>).</li>
<li><strong>gRPC server entrypoint</strong> (<a class="issue-link js-issue-link" href="https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/30190">#30190</a>): Alternative to REST API with binary protocol, HTTP/2 multiplexing.</li>
<li><strong><code>--max-model-len auto</code></strong> (<a class="issue-link js-issue-link" href="https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/29431">#29431</a>): Automatically fits context length to available GPU memory, eliminating OOM startup failures.</li>
<li><strong>Model inspection view</strong> (<a class="issue-link js-issue-link" href="https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/29450">#29450</a>): View the modules, attention backends, and quantization of your model in vLLM by specifying <code>VLLM_LOG_MODEL_INSPECTION=1</code> or by simply printing the <code>LLM</code> object.</li>
<li><strong>Model Runner V2 enhancements</strong>: UVA block tables (<a class="issue-link js-issue-link" href="https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/31965">#31965</a>), M-RoPE (<a class="issue-link js-issue-link" href="https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/32143">#32143</a>), <code>logit_bias</code>/<code>allowed_token_ids</code>/<code>min_tokens</code> support (<a class="issue-link js-issue-link" href="https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/32163">#32163</a>).
<ul>
<li>Please note that Model Runner V2 is still experimental and disabled by default.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

### [[$] Cleanup on aisle fsconfig()](https://lwn.net/Articles/1054228/)

**来源**: LWN.net (Linux Weekly News)

**摘要**: As part of the process of writing man pages for the <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/759499/">"new" mount API</a>, which has been available in the
kernel since 2019, Aleksa Sarai encountered a number of places where the <a href="https://manpages.opensuse.org/Tumbleweed/man-pages/fsconfig.2.en.html"><tt>fsconfig()</tt></a>
system call—for configuring filesystems before mounting—needs to be cleaned up.  In the 2025 Linux Plumbers Conference
(LPC) <a href="https://lpc.events/event/19/contributions/2239/">session</a> 
that he led, Sarai wanted to discuss some of the problems he found,
including at least one with security implications.  The idea of the session
was for him to describe the various bugs and ambiguities that he had found,
but he also wanted attendees to raise other problems they had with the
system call.

### [A data model for Git (and other docs updates)](https://jvns.ca/blog/2026/01/08/a-data-model-for-git/)

**来源**: Julia Evans

**摘要**: <p>Hello! This past fall, I decided to take some time to work on Git&rsquo;s
documentation. I&rsquo;ve been thinking about working on open source docs for a long
time &ndash; usually if I think the documentation for something could be improved,
I&rsquo;ll write a blog post or a zine or something. But this time I wondered: could I
instead make a few improvements to the official documentation?</p>
<p>So <a href="https://marieflanagan.com/">Marie</a> and I made a few changes to the Git
documentation!</p>
<h3 id="a-data-model-for-git">a data model for Git</h3>
<p>After a while working on the documentation, we noticed that Git uses the terms
&ldquo;object&rdquo;, &ldquo;reference&rdquo;, or &ldquo;index&rdquo; in its documentation a lot, but that it didn&rsquo;t
have a great explanation of what those terms mean or how they relate to other
core concepts like &ldquo;commit&rdquo; and &ldquo;branch&rdquo;. So we wrote a new &ldquo;data model&rdquo; document!</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/gitdatamodel.adoc">read the data model here for now</a>.
I assume at some point (after the next release?) it&rsquo;ll also be on the <a href="https://git-scm.com">Git website</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited about this because understanding how Git organizes its commit and
branch data has really helped me reason about how Git works over the years,
and I think it&rsquo;s important to have a short (1600 words!) version of the data
model that&rsquo;s accurate.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;accurate&rdquo; part turned out to not be that easy: I knew the basics of how
Git&rsquo;s data model worked, but during the review process I learned some new
details and had to make quite a few changes (for example how merge conflicts are
stored in the staging area).</p>
<h3 id="updates-to-git-push-git-pull-and-more">updates to <code>git push</code>, <code>git pull</code>, and more</h3>
<p>I also worked on updating the introduction to some of Git&rsquo;s core man pages.
I quickly realized that &ldquo;just try to improve it according to my best judgement&rdquo;
was not going to work: why should the maintainers believe me that my version is
better?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen a problem a lot when discussing open source documentation changes
where 2 expert users of the software argue about whether an explanation
is clear or not (&ldquo;I think X would be a good way to explain it! Well, I think Y
would be better!&rdquo;)</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think this is very productive (expert users of a piece of software
are notoriously bad at being able to tell if an explanation will be clear to
non-experts), so I needed to find a way to identify problems with the man
pages that was a little more evidence-based.</p>
<h3 id="getting-test-readers-to-identify-problems">getting test readers to identify problems</h3>
<p>I asked for test readers on Mastodon to read the current version of
documentation and tell me what they find confusing or what questions they have.
About 80 test readers left comments, and I learned so much!</p>
<p>People left a huge amount of great feedback, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>terminology they didn&rsquo;t understand (what&rsquo;s a pathspec? what does &ldquo;reference&rdquo; mean? does &ldquo;upstream&rdquo; have a specific meaning in Git?)</li>
<li>specific confusing sentences</li>
<li>suggestions of things things to add (&ldquo;I do X all the time, I think it should be included here&rdquo;)</li>
<li>inconsistencies (&ldquo;here it implies X is the default, but elsewhere it implies Y is the default&rdquo;)</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the test readers had been using Git for at least 5-10 years, which
I think worked well &ndash; if a group of test readers who have been using Git
regularly for 5+ years find a sentence or term impossible to understand, it
makes it easy to argue that the documentation should be updated to make it
clearer.</p>
<p>I thought this &ldquo;get users of the software to comment on the existing
documentation and then fix the problems they find&rdquo; pattern worked really
well and I&rsquo;m excited about potentially trying it again in the future.</p>
<h3 id="the-man-page-changes">the man page changes</h3>
<p>We ended updating these 4 man pages:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>git add</code> (<a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/2b3ae040/Documentation/git-add.adoc">before</a>, <a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/e0bfec3dfc356f7d808eb5ee546a54116b794397/Documentation/git-add.adoc">after</a>)</li>
<li><code>git checkout</code> (<a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/2b3ae040/Documentation/git-checkout.adoc">before</a>, <a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/e0bfec3dfc356f7d808eb5ee546a54116b794397/Documentation/git-checkout.adoc">after</a>)</li>
<li><code>git push</code> (<a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/2b3ae040/Documentation/git-push.adoc">before</a>, <a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/e0bfec3dfc356f7d808eb5ee546a54116b794397/Documentation/git-push.adoc">after</a>)</li>
<li><code>git pull</code> (<a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/2b3ae040/Documentation/git-pull.adoc">before</a>, <a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/e0bfec3dfc356f7d808eb5ee546a54116b794397/Documentation/git-pull.adoc">after</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>git push</code> and <code>git pull</code> changes were the most interesting to me: in
addition to updating the intro to those pages, we also ended up writing:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/e0bfec3dfc356f7d808eb5ee546a54116b794397/Documentation/urls-remotes.adoc#upstream-branches">a section describing what the term &ldquo;upstream branch&rdquo; means</a> (which previously wasn&rsquo;t really explained)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/e0bfec3dfc356f7d808eb5ee546a54116b794397/Documentation/git-push.adoc#options">a cleaned-up description of what a &ldquo;push refspec&rdquo; is</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Making those changes really gave me an appreciation for how much work it is
to maintain open source documentation: it&rsquo;s not easy to write things that are
both clear and true, and sometimes we had to make compromises, for example the sentence
&ldquo;<code>git push</code> may fail if you haven’t set an upstream for the current branch,
depending on what <code>push.default</code> is set to.&rdquo; is a little vague, but the exact
details of what &ldquo;depending&rdquo; means are really complicated and untangling that is
a big project.</p>
<h3 id="on-the-process-for-contributing-to-git">on the process for contributing to Git</h3>
<p>It took me a while to understand Git&rsquo;s development process.
I&rsquo;m not going to try to describe it here (that could be a whole other post!), but a few quick notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Git has a <a href="https://git-scm.com/community#discord">Discord server</a>
with a &ldquo;my first contribution&rdquo; channel for help with getting started contributing.
I found people to be very welcoming on the Discord.</li>
<li>I used <a href="https://gitgitgadget.github.io/">GitGitGadget</a> to make all of my contributions.
This meant that I could make a GitHub pull request (a workflow I&rsquo;m comfortable
with) and GitGitGadget would convert my PRs into the system the Git developers
use (emails with patches attached). GitGitGadget worked great and I was very
grateful to not have to learn how to send patches by email with Git.</li>
<li>Otherwise I used my normal email client (Fastmail&rsquo;s web interface) to reply
to emails, wrapping my text to 80 character lines since that&rsquo;s the mailing
list norm.</li>
</ul>
<p>I also found the mailing list archives on <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/git/">lore.kernel.org</a>
hard to navigate, so I hacked together <a href="https://github.com/jvns/git-list-viewer">my own git list viewer</a>
to make it easier to read the long mailing list threads.</p>
<p>Many people helped me navigate the contribution process and review the changes:
thanks to Emily Shaffer, Johannes Schindelin (the author of GitGitGadget),
Patrick Steinhardt, Ben Knoble, Junio Hamano, and more.</p>
<p>(I&rsquo;m experimenting with <a href="https://comments.jvns.ca/post/115861337435768520">comments on Mastodon, you can see the comments here</a>)</p>

### [Notes on switching to Helix from vim](https://jvns.ca/blog/2025/10/10/notes-on-switching-to-helix-from-vim/)

**来源**: Julia Evans

**摘要**: <p>Hello! Earlier this summer I was talking to a friend about how much I
<a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2024/09/12/reasons-i--still--love-fish/">love using fish</a>, and
how I love that I don&rsquo;t have to configure it. They said that they feel the same
way about the <a href="https://helix-editor.com/">helix</a> text editor, and so I decided
to give it a try.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using it for 3 months now and here are a few notes.</p>
<h3 id="why-helix-language-servers">why helix: language servers</h3>
<p>I think what motivated me to try Helix is that I&rsquo;ve been trying to get a working
language server setup (so I can do things like &ldquo;go to definition&rdquo;) and getting
a setup that feels good in Vim or Neovim just felt like too much work.</p>
<p>After using Vim/Neovim for 20 years, I&rsquo;ve tried both &ldquo;build my own custom
configuration from scratch&rdquo; and &ldquo;use someone else&rsquo;s pre-buld configuration
system&rdquo; and even though I love Vim I was excited about having things just work
without having to work on my configuration at all.</p>
<p>Helix comes with built in language server support, and it feels nice
to be able to do things like &ldquo;rename this symbol&rdquo; in any language.</p>
<h3 id="the-search-is-great">the search is great</h3>
<p>One of my favourite things about Helix is the search! If I&rsquo;m searching all the
files in my repository for a string, it lets me scroll through the potential
matching files and see the full context of the match, like this:</p>
<img src="https://jvns.ca/images/helix-search.png" />
<p>For comparison, here&rsquo;s what the vim ripgrep plugin I&rsquo;ve been using looks like:</p>
<img src="https://jvns.ca/images/vim-ripgrep.png" />
<p>There&rsquo;s no context for what else is around that line.</p>
<h3 id="the-quick-reference-is-nice">the quick reference is nice</h3>
<p>One thing I like about Helix is that when I press <code>g</code>, I get a little help popup
telling me places I can go. I really appreciate this because I don&rsquo;t often use
the &ldquo;go to definition&rdquo; or &ldquo;go to reference&rdquo; feature and I often forget the
keyboard shortcut.</p>
<img src="https://jvns.ca/images/goto.png" width="300px" />
<h3 id="some-vim-helix-translations">some vim -&gt; helix translations</h3>
<ul>
<li>Helix doesn&rsquo;t have marks like <code>ma</code>, <code>'a</code>, instead I&rsquo;ve been using <code>Ctrl+O</code> and
<code>Ctrl+I</code> to go back (or forward) to the last cursor location</li>
<li>I think Helix does have macros, but I&rsquo;ve been using multiple cursors in every
case that I would have previously used a macro. I like multiple cursors a lot
more than writing macros all the time. If I want to batch change something in
the document, my workflow is to press <code>%</code> (to highlight everything), then <code>s</code>
to select (with a regex) the things I want to change, then I can just edit
all of them as needed.</li>
<li>Helix doesn&rsquo;t have neovim-style tabs, instead it has a nice buffer switcher (<code>&lt;space&gt;b</code>)
I can use to switch to the buffer I want. There&rsquo;s a
<a href="https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/pull/7109">pull request here</a> to implement neovim-style tabs.
There&rsquo;s also a setting <code>bufferline=&quot;multiple&quot;</code> which can act a bit like tabs
with <code>gp</code>, <code>gn</code> for prev/next &ldquo;tab&rdquo; and <code>:bc</code> to close a &ldquo;tab&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="some-helix-annoyances">some helix annoyances</h3>
<p>Here&rsquo;s everything that&rsquo;s annoyed me about Helix so far.</p>
<ul>
<li>I like the way Helix&rsquo;s <code>:reflow</code> works much less than how
vim reflows text with <code>gq</code>. It doesn&rsquo;t work as well with lists. (<a href="https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/issues/3332">github issue</a>)</li>
<li>If I&rsquo;m making a Markdown list, pressing &ldquo;enter&rdquo; at the end of a list item
won&rsquo;t continue the list. There&rsquo;s a <a href="https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/wiki/Recipes#continue-markdown-lists--quotes">partial workaround</a>
for bulleted lists but I don&rsquo;t know one for numbered lists.</li>
<li>No persistent undo yet: in vim I could use an
<a href="https://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/options.html#'undofile'">undofile</a> so
that I could undo changes even after quitting. Helix doesn&rsquo;t have that feature yet.
(<a href="https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/pull/9154">github PR</a>)</li>
<li>Helix doesn&rsquo;t autoreload files after they change on disk, I have to run
<code>:reload-all</code> (<code>:ra&lt;tab&gt;</code>) to manually reload them. Not a big deal.</li>
<li>Sometimes it crashes, maybe every week or so. I think it might be
<a href="https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/issues/12582">this issue</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The &ldquo;markdown list&rdquo; and reflowing issues come up a lot for me because I spend
a lot of time editing Markdown lists, but I keep using Helix anyway so I guess
they can&rsquo;t be making me that mad.</p>
<h3 id="switching-was-easier-than-i-thought">switching was easier than I thought</h3>
<p>I was worried that relearning 20 years of Vim muscle memory would be really hard.</p>
<p>It turned out to be easier than I expected, I started using Helix on a
vacation for a little low-stakes coding project I was doing on the side and
after a week or two it didn&rsquo;t feel so disorienting anymore. I think it might be
hard to switch back and forth between Vim and Helix, but I haven&rsquo;t needed to use
Vim recently so I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;ll ever become an issue for me.</p>
<p>The first time I tried Helix I tried to force it to use keybindings that were
more similar to Vim and that did not work for me. Just learning the &ldquo;Helix way&rdquo;
was a lot easier.</p>
<p>There are still some things that throw me off: for example <code>w</code> in vim and <code>w</code> in
Helix don&rsquo;t have the same idea of what a &ldquo;word&rdquo; is (the Helix one includes the
space after the word, the Vim one doesn&rsquo;t).</p>
<h3 id="using-a-terminal-based-text-editor">using a terminal-based text editor</h3>
<p>For many years I&rsquo;d mostly been using a GUI version of vim/neovim, so switching
to actually using an editor in the terminal was a bit of an adjustment.</p>
<p>I ended up deciding on:</p>
<ol>
<li>Every project gets its own terminal window, and all of the tabs in that
window (mostly) have the same working directory</li>
<li>I make my Helix tab the first tab in the terminal window</li>
</ol>
<p>It works pretty well, I might actually like it better than my previous workflow.</p>
<h3 id="my-configuration">my configuration</h3>
<p>I appreciate that my configuration is really simple, compared to my neovim
configuration which is hundreds of lines. It&rsquo;s mostly just 4 keyboard
shortcuts.</p>
<pre><code>theme = &quot;solarized_light&quot;
[editor]
# Sync clipboard with system clipboard
default-yank-register = &quot;+&quot;

[keys.normal]
# I didn't like that Ctrl+C was the default &quot;toggle comments&quot; shortcut
&quot;#&quot; = &quot;toggle_comments&quot;

# I didn't feel like learning a different way
# to go to the beginning/end of a line so
# I remapped ^ and $
&quot;^&quot; = &quot;goto_first_nonwhitespace&quot;
&quot;$&quot; = &quot;goto_line_end&quot;

[keys.select]
&quot;^&quot; = &quot;goto_first_nonwhitespace&quot;
&quot;$&quot; = &quot;goto_line_end&quot;

[keys.normal.space]
# I write a lot of text so I need to constantly reflow,
# and missed vim's `gq` shortcut
l = &quot;:reflow&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>There&rsquo;s a separate <code>languages.toml</code> configuration where I set some language
preferences, like turning off autoformatting.
For example, here&rsquo;s my Python configuration:</p>
<pre><code>[[language]]
name = &quot;python&quot;
formatter = { command = &quot;black&quot;, args = [&quot;--stdin-filename&quot;, &quot;%{buffer_name}&quot;, &quot;-&quot;] }
language-servers = [&quot;pyright&quot;]
auto-format = false
</code></pre>
<h3 id="we-ll-see-how-it-goes">we&rsquo;ll see how it goes</h3>
<p>Three months is not that long, and it&rsquo;s possible that I&rsquo;ll decide to go back
to Vim at some point. For example, I wrote a <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/02/28/some-notes-on-using-nix/">post about switching to
nix</a> a while back but
after maybe 8 months I switched back to Homebrew (though I&rsquo;m still using NixOS
to manage one little server, and I&rsquo;m still satisfied with that).</p>

**摘要**: <p>Hello! After many months of writing deep dive blog posts about the terminal, on
Tuesday I released a new zine called &ldquo;The Secret Rules of the Terminal&rdquo;!</p>
<p>You can get it for $12 here:

</a>
<h3 id="why-the-terminal">why the terminal?</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using the terminal every day for 20 years but even though I&rsquo;m very
confident in the terminal, I&rsquo;ve always had a bit of an uneasy feeling about it.
Usually things work fine, but sometimes something goes wrong and it just feels
like investigating it is impossible, or at least like it would open up a huge
can of worms.</p>
<p>So I started trying to write down a list of weird problems I&rsquo;ve run into in terminal and I realized
that the terminal has a lot of tiny inconsistencies like:</p>
<ul>
<li>sometimes you can use the arrow keys to move around, but sometimes pressing the arrow keys just prints <code>^[[D</code></li>
<li>sometimes you can use the mouse to select text, but sometimes you can&rsquo;t</li>
<li>sometimes your commands get saved to a history when you run them, and sometimes they don&rsquo;t</li>
<li>some shells let you use the up arrow to see the previous command, and some don&rsquo;t</li>
</ul>
<p>If you use the terminal daily for 10 or 20 years, even if you don&rsquo;t understand
exactly <em>why</em> these things happen, you&rsquo;ll probably build an intuition for them.</p>
<p>But having an intuition for them isn&rsquo;t the same as understanding why they
happen. When writing this zine I actually had to do a lot of work to figure out
exactly what was <em>happening</em> in the terminal to be able to talk about how to
reason about it.</p>
<h3 id="the-rules-aren-t-written-down-anywhere">the rules aren&rsquo;t written down anywhere</h3>
<p>It turns out that the &ldquo;rules&rdquo; for how the terminal works (how do
you edit a command you type in? how do you quit a program? how do you fix your
colours?) are extremely hard to fully understand, because &ldquo;the terminal&rdquo; is actually
made of many different pieces of software (your terminal emulator, your
operating system, your shell, the core utilities like <code>grep</code>, and every other random
terminal program you&rsquo;ve installed) which are written by different people with different
ideas about how things should work.</p>
<p>So I wanted to write something that would explain:</p>
<ul>
<li>how the 4 pieces of the terminal (your shell, terminal emulator, programs, and TTY driver) fit together to make everything work</li>
<li>some of the core conventions for how you can expect things in your terminal to work</li>
<li>lots of tips and tricks for how to use terminal programs</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="this-zine-explains-the-most-useful-parts-of-terminal-internals">this zine explains the most useful parts of terminal internals</h3>
<p>Terminal internals are a mess. A lot of it is just the way it is because
someone made a decision in the 80s and now it&rsquo;s impossible to change, and
honestly I don&rsquo;t think learning everything about terminal internals is worth
it.</p>
<p>But some parts are not that hard to understand and can really make your
experience in the terminal better, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you understand what <strong>your shell</strong> is responsible for, you can configure your shell (or use a different one!) to access your history more easily, get great tab completion, and so much more</li>
<li>if you understand <strong>escape codes</strong>, it&rsquo;s much less scary when <code>cat</code>ing a binary to stdout messes up your terminal, you can just type <code>reset</code> and move on</li>
<li>if you understand how <strong>colour</strong> works, you can get rid of bad colour contrast in your terminal so you can actually read the text</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="i-learned-a-surprising-amount-writing-this-zine">I learned a surprising amount writing this zine</h3>
<p>When I wrote <a href="https://wizardzines.com/zines/git">How Git Works</a>, I thought I
knew how Git worked, and I was right. But the terminal is different. Even
though I feel totally confident in the terminal and even though I&rsquo;ve used it
every day for 20 years, I had a lot of misunderstandings about how the terminal
works and (unless you&rsquo;re the author of <code>tmux</code> or something) I think there&rsquo;s a
good chance you do too.</p>
<p>A few things I learned that are actually useful to me:</p>
<ul>
<li>I understand the structure of the terminal better and so I feel more
confident debugging weird terminal stuff that happens to me (I was even able
to suggest a <a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10834">small improvement</a> to fish!). Identifying exactly which piece of software is causing a weird thing to happen in my terminal still isn&rsquo;t <em>easy</em> but I&rsquo;m a lot better at it now.</li>
<li>you can write a shell script to <a href="https://jvns.ca/til/vim-osc52/">copy to your clipboard over SSH</a></li>
<li>how <code>reset</code> works under the hood (it does the equivalent of <code>stty sane; sleep 1; tput reset</code>) – basically I learned that I don&rsquo;t ever need to worry about
remembering <code>stty sane</code> or <code>tput reset</code> and I can just run <code>reset</code> instead</li>
<li>how to look at the invisible escape codes that a program is printing out (run <code>unbuffer program &gt; out; less out</code>)</li>
<li>why the builtin REPLs on my Mac like <code>sqlite3</code> are so annoying to use (they use <code>libedit</code> instead of <code>readline</code>)</li>
</ul>

### [Using `make` to compile C programs (for non-C-programmers)](https://jvns.ca/blog/2025/06/10/how-to-compile-a-c-program/)

**来源**: Julia Evans

**摘要**: <p>I have never been a C programmer but every so often I need to compile a C/C++
program from source. This has been kind of a struggle for me: for a
long time, my approach was basically &ldquo;install the dependencies, run <code>make</code>, if
it doesn&rsquo;t work, either try to find a binary someone has compiled or give up&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope someone else has compiled it&rdquo; worked pretty well when I was running Linux
but since I&rsquo;ve been using a Mac for the last couple of years I&rsquo;ve been running
into more situations where I have to actually compile programs myself.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about what you might have to do to compile a C program! I&rsquo;ll use
a couple of examples of specific C programs I&rsquo;ve compiled and talk about a few
things that can go wrong. Here are three programs we&rsquo;ll be talking about
compiling:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://mj.ucw.cz/sw/paperjam/">paperjam</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.sqlite.org/download.html">sqlite</a></li>
<li><a href="https://git.causal.agency/src/tree/bin/qf.c">qf</a> (a pager you can run to quickly open files from a search with <code>rg -n THING | qf</code>)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-1-install-a-c-compiler">step 1: install a C compiler</h3>
<p>This is pretty simple: on an Ubuntu system if I don&rsquo;t already have a C compiler I&rsquo;ll install one with:</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt-get install build-essential
</code></pre>
<p>This installs <code>gcc</code>, <code>g++</code>, and <code>make</code>. The situation on a Mac is more
confusing but it&rsquo;s something like &ldquo;install xcode command line tools&rdquo;.</p>
<h3 id="step-2-install-the-program-s-dependencies">step 2: install the program&rsquo;s dependencies</h3>
<p>Unlike some newer programming languages, C doesn&rsquo;t have a dependency manager.
So if a program has any dependencies, you need to hunt them down yourself.
Thankfully because of this, C programmers usually keep their dependencies very
minimal and often the dependencies will be available in whatever package manager you&rsquo;re using.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s almost always a section explaining how to get the dependencies in the
README, for example in <a href="https://mj.ucw.cz/sw/paperjam/">paperjam</a>&rsquo;s README, it
says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To compile PaperJam, you need the headers for the libqpdf and libpaper libraries (usually available as libqpdf-dev and libpaper-dev packages).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You may need <code>a2x</code> (found in <a href="http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/a2x.1.html">AsciiDoc</a>) for building manual pages.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So on a Debian-based system you can install the dependencies like this.</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt install -y libqpdf-dev libpaper-dev
</code></pre>
<p>If a README gives a name for a package (like <code>libqpdf-dev</code>), I&rsquo;d basically
always assume that they mean &ldquo;in a Debian-based Linux distro&rdquo;: if you&rsquo;re on a
Mac <code>brew install libqpdf-dev</code> will not work. I still have not 100% gotten
the hang of developing on a Mac yet so I don&rsquo;t have many tips there yet. I
guess in this case it would be <code>brew install qpdf</code> if you&rsquo;re using Homebrew.</p>
<h3 id="step-3-run-configure-if-needed">step 3: run <code>./configure</code> (if needed)</h3>
<p>Some C programs come with a <code>Makefile</code> and some instead come with a script called
<code>./configure</code>. For example, if you download <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/download.html">sqlite&rsquo;s source code</a>, it has a <code>./configure</code> script in
it instead of a Makefile.</p>
<p>My understanding of this <code>./configure</code> script is:</p>
<ol>
<li>You run it, it prints out a lot of somewhat inscrutable output, and then it
either generates a <code>Makefile</code> or fails because you&rsquo;re missing some
dependency</li>
<li>The <code>./configure</code> script is part of a system called
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/Autotools-Introduction.html">autotools</a>
that I have never needed to learn anything about beyond &ldquo;run it to generate
a <code>Makefile</code>&rdquo;.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think there might be some options you can pass to get the <code>./configure</code>
script to produce a different <code>Makefile</code> but I have never done that.</p>
<h3 id="step-4-run-make">step 4: run <code>make</code></h3>
<p>The next step is to run <code>make</code> to try to build a program. Some notes about
<code>make</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes you can run <code>make -j8</code> to parallelize the build and make it go
faster</li>
<li>It usually prints out a million compiler warnings when compiling the program.
I always just ignore them. I didn&rsquo;t write the software! The compiler warnings
are not my problem.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="compiler-errors-are-often-dependency-problems">compiler errors are often dependency problems</h3>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an error I got while compiling <code>paperjam</code> on my Mac:</p>
<pre><code>/opt/homebrew/Cellar/qpdf/12.0.0/include/qpdf/InputSource.hh:85:19: error: function definition does not declare parameters
   85 |     qpdf_offset_t last_offset{0};
      |                   ^
</code></pre>
<p>Over the years I&rsquo;ve learned it&rsquo;s usually best not to overthink problems like
this: if it&rsquo;s talking about <code>qpdf</code>, there&rsquo;s a good change it just means that
I&rsquo;ve done something wrong with how I&rsquo;m including the <code>qpdf</code> dependency.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s talk about some ways to get the <code>qpdf</code> dependency included in the right way.</p>
<h3 id="the-world-s-shortest-introduction-to-the-compiler-and-linker">the world&rsquo;s shortest introduction to the compiler and linker</h3>
<p>Before we talk about how to fix dependency problems: building C programs is split into 2
steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Compiling</strong> the code into <strong>object files</strong> (with <code>gcc</code> or <code>clang</code>)</li>
<li><strong>Linking</strong> those object files into a final binary (with <code>ld</code>)</li>
</ol>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to know this when building a C program because sometimes you
need to pass the right flags to the compiler and linker to tell them where to
find the dependencies for the program you&rsquo;re compiling.</p>
<h3 id="make-uses-environment-variables-to-configure-the-compiler-and-linker"><code>make</code> uses environment variables to configure the compiler and linker</h3>
<p>If I run <code>make</code> on my Mac to install <code>paperjam</code>, I get this error:</p>
<pre><code>c++ -o paperjam paperjam.o pdf-tools.o parse.o cmds.o pdf.o -lqpdf -lpaper
ld: library 'qpdf' not found
</code></pre>
<p>This is not because <code>qpdf</code> is not installed on my system (it actually is!). But
the compiler and linker don&rsquo;t know how to <em>find</em> the <code>qpdf</code> library. To fix this, we need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>pass <code>&quot;-I/opt/homebrew/include&quot;</code> to the compiler (to tell it where to find the header files)</li>
<li>pass <code>&quot;-L/opt/homebrew/lib -liconv&quot;</code> to the linker (to tell it where to find library files and to link in <code>iconv</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>And we can get <code>make</code> to pass those extra parameters to the compiler and linker using environment variables!
To see how this works: inside <code>paperjam</code>&rsquo;s Makefile you can see a bunch of environment variables, like <code>LDLIBS</code> here:</p>
<pre><code>paperjam: $(OBJS)
	$(LD) -o $@ $^ $(LDLIBS)
</code></pre>
<p>Everything you put into the <code>LDLIBS</code> environment variable gets passed to the
linker (<code>ld</code>) as a command line argument.</p>
<h3 id="secret-environment-variable-cppflags">secret environment variable: <code>CPPFLAGS</code></h3>
<p><code>Makefiles</code> sometimes define their own environment variables that they pass to
the compiler/linker, but <code>make</code> also has a bunch of &ldquo;implicit&rdquo; environment
variables which it will automatically pass to the C compiler and linker. There&rsquo;s a <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Implicit-Variables.html#index-CFLAGS0">full list of implicit environment variables here</a>,
but one of them is <code>CPPFLAGS</code>, which gets automatically passed to the C compiler.</p>
<p>(technically it would be more normal to use <code>CXXFLAGS</code> for this, but this
particular <code>Makefile</code> hardcodes <code>CXXFLAGS</code> so setting <code>CPPFLAGS</code> was the only
way I could find to set the compiler flags without editing the <code>Makefile</code>)</p>
<small>
As an aside: it took me a long time to realize how closely tied to C/C++ `make` is -- I used
to think that `make` was just a general build system (and of course you can use it for
anything!) but it has a lot of affordances for building C/C++ programs that it
doesn't have for building any other kind of program.
</small>
<h3 id="two-ways-to-pass-environment-variables-to-make">two ways to pass environment variables to <code>make</code></h3>
<p>I learned thanks to <a href="https://www.owlfolio.org/">@zwol</a> that there are actually two ways to pass environment variables to <code>make</code>:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>CXXFLAGS=xyz make</code> (the usual way)</li>
<li><code>make CXXFLAGS=xyz</code></li>
</ol>
<p>The difference between them is that <code>make CXXFLAGS=xyz</code> will override the
value of <code>CXXFLAGS</code> set in the <code>Makefile</code> but <code>CXXFLAGS=xyz make</code> won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure which way is the norm but I&rsquo;m going to use the first way in this
post.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-use-cppflags-and-ldlibs-to-fix-this-compiler-error">how to use <code>CPPFLAGS</code> and <code>LDLIBS</code> to fix this compiler error</h3>
<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve talked about how <code>CPPFLAGS</code> and <code>LDLIBS</code> get passed to the
compiler and linker, here&rsquo;s the final incantation that I used to get the
program to build successfully!</p>
<pre><code>CPPFLAGS=&quot;-I/opt/homebrew/include&quot; LDLIBS=&quot;-L/opt/homebrew/lib -liconv&quot; make paperjam
</code></pre>
<p>This passes <code>-I/opt/homebrew/include</code> to the compiler and <code>-L/opt/homebrew/lib -liconv</code> to the linker.</p>
<p>Also I don&rsquo;t want to pretend that I &ldquo;magically&rdquo; knew that those were the right
arguments to pass, figuring them out involved a bunch of confused Googling that I
skipped over in this post. I will say that:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <code>-I</code> compiler flag tells the compiler which directory to find header files in, like <code>/opt/homebrew/include/qpdf/QPDF.hh</code></li>
<li>the <code>-L</code> linker flag tells the linker which directory to find libraries in, like <code>/opt/homebrew/lib/libqpdf.a</code></li>
<li>the <code>-l</code> linker flag tells the linker which libraries to link in, like <code>-liconv</code> means &ldquo;link in the <code>iconv</code> library&rdquo;, or <code>-lm</code> means &ldquo;link <code>math</code>&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="tip-how-to-just-build-1-specific-file-make-filename">tip: how to just build 1 specific file: <code>make $FILENAME</code></h3>
<p>Yesterday I discovered this cool tool called
<a href="https://git.causal.agency/src/tree/bin/qf.c">qf</a> which you can use to quickly
open files from the output of <code>ripgrep</code>.</p>
<p><code>qf</code> is in a big directory of various tools, but I only wanted to compile <code>qf</code>.
So I just compiled <code>qf</code>, like this:</p>
<pre><code>make qf
</code></pre>
<p>Basically if you know (or can guess) the output filename of the file you&rsquo;re
trying to build, you can tell <code>make</code> to just build that file by running <code>make $FILENAME</code></p>
<h3 id="tip-you-don-t-need-a-makefile">tip: you don&rsquo;t need a Makefile</h3>
<p>I sometimes write 5-line C programs with no dependencies, and I just learned
that if I have a file called <code>blah.c</code>, I can just compile it like this without creating a <code>Makefile</code>:</p>
<pre><code>make blah
</code></pre>
<p>It gets automaticaly expanded to <code>cc -o blah blah.c</code>, which saves a bit of
typing. I have no idea if I&rsquo;m going to remember this (I might just keep typing
<code>gcc -o blah blah.c</code> anyway) but it seems like a fun trick.</p>
<h3 id="tip-look-at-how-other-packaging-systems-built-the-same-c-program">tip: look at how other packaging systems built the same C program</h3>
<p>If you&rsquo;re having trouble building a C program, maybe other people had problems building it
too! Every Linux distribution has build files for every package that they
build, so even if you can&rsquo;t install packages from that distribution directly,
maybe you can get tips from that Linux distro for how to build the package.
Realizing this (thanks to my friend Dave) was a huge ah-ha moment for me.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/405624e81a9b65378328accb0a11c3e5369e651c/pkgs/by-name/pa/paperjam/package.nix#L35">this line from the nix package for <code>paperjam</code></a> says:</p>
<pre><code>  env.NIX_LDFLAGS = lib.optionalString stdenv.hostPlatform.isDarwin &quot;-liconv&quot;;
</code></pre>
<p>This is basically saying &ldquo;pass the linker flag <code>-liconv</code> to build this on a
Mac&rdquo;, so that&rsquo;s a clue we could use to build it.</p>
<p>That same file also says <code>  env.NIX_CFLAGS_COMPILE = &quot;-DPOINTERHOLDER_TRANSITION=1&quot;;</code>. I&rsquo;m not sure what this means, but when I try
to build the <code>paperjam</code> package I do get an error about something called a
<code>PointerHolder</code>, so I guess that&rsquo;s somehow related to the &ldquo;PointerHolder
transition&rdquo;.</p>
<h3 id="step-5-installing-the-binary">step 5: installing the binary</h3>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve managed to compile the program, probably you want to install it somewhere!
Some <code>Makefile</code>s have an <code>install</code> target that let you install the tool on your
system with <code>make install</code>. I&rsquo;m always a bit scared of this (where is it going
to put the files? what if I want to uninstall them later?), so if I&rsquo;m compiling
a pretty simple program I&rsquo;ll often just manually copy the binary to install it
instead, like this:</p>
<pre><code>cp qf ~/bin
</code></pre>
<h3 id="step-6-maybe-make-your-own-package">step 6: maybe make your own package!</h3>
<p>Once I figured out how to do all of this, I realized that I could use my new
<code>make</code> knowledge to contribute a <code>paperjam</code> package to Homebrew! Then I could
just <code>brew install paperjam</code> on future systems.</p>
<p>The good thing is that even if the details of how all of the different
packaging systems, they fundamentally all use C compilers and linkers.</p>
<h3 id="it-can-be-useful-to-understand-a-little-about-c-even-if-you-re-not-a-c-programmer">it can be useful to understand a little about C even if you&rsquo;re not a C programmer</h3>
<p>I think all of this is an interesting example of how it can useful to
understand some basics of how C programs work (like &ldquo;they have header files&rdquo;)
even if you&rsquo;re never planning to write a nontrivial C program if your life.</p>
<p>It feels good to have some ability to compile C/C++ programs myself, even
though I&rsquo;m still not totally confident about all of the compiler and linker
flags and I still plan to never learn anything about how autotools works other
than &ldquo;you run <code>./configure</code> to generate the <code>Makefile</code>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Two things I left out of this post:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH / DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> (which you use to tell the dynamic
linker at runtime where to find dynamically linked files) because I can&rsquo;t
remember the last time I ran into an <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> issue and couldn&rsquo;t
find an example.</li>
<li><code>pkg-config</code>, which I think is important but I don&rsquo;t understand yet</li>
</ul>

### [Standards for ANSI escape codes](https://jvns.ca/blog/2025/03/07/escape-code-standards/)

**来源**: Julia Evans

**摘要**: <p>Hello! Today I want to talk about ANSI escape codes.</p>
<p>For a long time I was vaguely aware of ANSI escape codes (&ldquo;that&rsquo;s how you make
text red in the terminal and stuff&rdquo;) but I had no real understanding of where they were
supposed to be defined or whether or not there were standards for them. I just
had a kind of vague &ldquo;there be dragons&rdquo; feeling around them. While learning
about the terminal this year, I&rsquo;ve learned that:</p>
<ol>
<li>ANSI escape codes are responsible for a lot of usability improvements
in the terminal (did you know there&rsquo;s a way to copy to your system clipboard
when SSHed into a remote machine?? It&rsquo;s an escape code called <a href="https://jvns.ca/til/vim-osc52/">OSC 52</a>!)</li>
<li>They aren&rsquo;t completely standardized, and because of that they don&rsquo;t always
work reliably. And because they&rsquo;re also invisible, it&rsquo;s extremely
frustrating to troubleshoot escape code issues.</li>
</ol>
<p>So I wanted to put together a list for myself of some standards that exist
around escape codes, because I want to know if they <em>have</em> to feel unreliable
and frustrating, or if there&rsquo;s a future where we could all rely on them with
more confidence.</p>

<h3 id="what-s-an-escape-code">what&rsquo;s an escape code?</h3>
<p>Have you ever pressed the left arrow key in your terminal and seen <code>^[[D</code>?
That&rsquo;s an escape code! It&rsquo;s called an &ldquo;escape code&rdquo; because the first character
is the &ldquo;escape&rdquo; character, which is usually written as <code>ESC</code>, <code>\x1b</code>, <code>\E</code>,
<code>\033</code>, or <code>^[</code>.</p>
<p>Escape codes are how your terminal emulator communicates various kinds of
information (colours, mouse movement, etc) with programs running in the
terminal. There are two kind of escape codes:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>input codes</strong> which your terminal emulator sends for keypresses or mouse
movements that don&rsquo;t fit into Unicode. For example &ldquo;left arrow key&rdquo; is
<code>ESC[D</code>, &ldquo;Ctrl+left arrow&rdquo; might be <code>ESC[1;5D</code>, and clicking the mouse might
be something like <code>ESC[M :3</code>.</li>
<li><strong>output codes</strong> which programs can print out to colour text, move the
cursor around, clear the screen, hide the cursor, copy text to the
clipboard, enable mouse reporting, set the window title, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s talk about standards!</p>
<h3 id="ecma-48">ECMA-48</h3>
<p>The first standard I found relating to escape codes was
<a href="https://ecma-international.org/wp-content/uploads/ECMA-48_5th_edition_june_1991.pdf">ECMA-48</a>,
which was originally published in 1976.</p>
<p>ECMA-48 does two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Define some general <em>formats</em> for escape codes (like &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; codes, which are
<code>ESC[</code> + something and &ldquo;OSC&rdquo; codes, which are <code>ESC]</code> + something)</li>
<li>Define some specific escape codes, like how &ldquo;move the cursor to the left&rdquo; is
<code>ESC[D</code>, or &ldquo;turn text red&rdquo; is  <code>ESC[31m</code>. In the spec, the &ldquo;cursor left&rdquo;
one is called <code>CURSOR LEFT</code> and the one for changing colours is called
<code>SELECT GRAPHIC RENDITION</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The formats are extensible, so there&rsquo;s room for others to define more escape
codes in the future. Lots of escape codes that are popular today aren&rsquo;t defined
in ECMA-48: for example it&rsquo;s pretty common for terminal applications (like vim,
htop, or tmux) to support using the mouse, but ECMA-48 doesn&rsquo;t define escape
codes for the mouse.</p>
<h3 id="xterm-control-sequences">xterm control sequences</h3>
<p>There are a bunch of escape codes that aren&rsquo;t defined in ECMA-48, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>enabling mouse reporting (where did you click in your terminal?)</li>
<li>bracketed paste (did you paste that text or type it in?)</li>
<li>OSC 52 (which terminal applications can use to copy text to your system clipboard)</li>
</ul>
<p>I believe (correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong!) that these and some others came from
xterm, are documented in <a href="https://invisible-island.net/xterm/ctlseqs/ctlseqs.html">XTerm Control Sequences</a>, and have
been widely implemented by other terminal emulators.</p>
<p>This list of &ldquo;what xterm supports&rdquo; is not a standard exactly, but xterm is
extremely influential and so it seems like an important document.</p>
<h3 id="terminfo">terminfo</h3>
<p>In the 80s (and to some extent today, but my understanding is that it was MUCH
more dramatic in the 80s) there was a huge amount of variation in what escape
codes terminals actually supported.</p>
<p>To deal with this, there&rsquo;s a database of escape codes for various terminals
called &ldquo;terminfo&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It looks like the standard for terminfo is called <a href="https://publications.opengroup.org/c243-1">X/Open Curses</a>, though you need to create
an account to view that standard for some reason. It defines the database format as well
as a C library interface (&ldquo;curses&rdquo;) for accessing the database.</p>
<p>For example you can run this bash snippet to see every possible escape code for
&ldquo;clear screen&rdquo; for all of the different terminals your system knows about:</p>
<pre><code>for term in $(toe -a | awk '{print $1}')
do
  echo $term
  infocmp -1 -T &quot;$term&quot; 2&gt;/dev/null | grep 'clear=' | sed 's/clear=//g;s/,//g'
done
</code></pre>
<p>On my system (and probably every system I&rsquo;ve ever used?), the terminfo database is managed by ncurses.</p>
<h3 id="should-programs-use-terminfo">should programs use terminfo?</h3>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s interesting that there are two main approaches that applications
take to handling ANSI escape codes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use the terminfo database to figure out which escape codes to use, depending
on what&rsquo;s in the <code>TERM</code> environment variable. Fish does this, for example.</li>
<li>Identify a &ldquo;single common set&rdquo; of escape codes which works in &ldquo;enough&rdquo;
terminal emulators and just hardcode those.</li>
</ol>
<p>Some examples of programs/libraries that take approach #2 (&ldquo;don&rsquo;t use terminfo&rdquo;) include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/commit/c12699d2e9c2806d6ed184032078d0b84a3370bb">kakoune</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit/blob/165258d2f3ae594b50f16c7b50ffb06627476269/src/prompt_toolkit/input/ansi_escape_sequences.py#L5-L8">python-prompt-toolkit</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/antirez/linenoise">linenoise</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rockorager/libvaxis">libvaxis</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/chalk/chalk">chalk</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I got curious about why folks might be moving away from terminfo and I found
this very interesting and extremely detailed
<a href="https://twoot.site/@bean/113056942625234032">rant about terminfo from one of the fish maintainers</a>, which argues that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[the terminfo authors] have done a lot of work that, at the time, was
extremely important and helpful. My point is that it no longer is.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to do it justice so I&rsquo;m not going to summarize it, I think it&rsquo;s
worth reading.</p>
<h3 id="is-there-a-single-common-set-of-escape-codes">is there a &ldquo;single common set&rdquo; of escape codes?</h3>
<p>I was just talking about the idea that you can use a &ldquo;common set&rdquo; of escape
codes that will work for most people. But what is that set? Is there any agreement?</p>
<p>I really do not know the answer to this at all, but from doing some reading it
seems like it&rsquo;s some combination of:</p>
<ul>
<li>The codes that the VT100 supported (though some aren&rsquo;t relevant on modern terminals)</li>
<li>what&rsquo;s in ECMA-48 (which I think also has some things that are no longer relevant)</li>
<li>What xterm supports (though I&rsquo;d guess that not everything in there is actually widely supported enough)</li>
</ul>
<p>and maybe ultimately &ldquo;identify the terminal emulators you think your users are
going to use most frequently and test in those&rdquo;, the same way web developers do
when deciding which CSS features are okay to use</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there are any resources like <a href="https://caniuse.com/">Can I use&hellip;?</a> or
<a href="https://web-platform-dx.github.io/web-features/">Baseline</a> for the terminal
though. (in theory terminfo is supposed to be the &ldquo;caniuse&rdquo; for the terminal
but it seems like it often takes 10+ years to add new terminal features when
people invent them which makes it very limited)</p>
<h3 id="some-reasons-to-use-terminfo">some reasons to use terminfo</h3>
<p>I also asked on Mastodon why people found terminfo valuable in 2025 and got a
few reasons that made sense to me:</p>
<ul>
<li>some people expect to be able to use the <code>TERM</code> environment variable to
control how programs behave (for example with <code>TERM=dumb</code>), and there&rsquo;s
no standard for how that should work in a post-terminfo world</li>
<li>even though there&rsquo;s <em>less</em> variation between terminal emulators than
there was in the 80s, there&rsquo;s far from zero variation: there are graphical
terminals, the Linux framebuffer console, the situation you&rsquo;re in when
connecting to a server via its serial console, Emacs shell mode, and probably
more that I&rsquo;m missing</li>
<li>there is no one standard for what the &ldquo;single common set&rdquo; of escape codes
is, and sometimes programs use escape codes which aren&rsquo;t actually widely
supported enough</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="terminfo-user-agent-detection">terminfo &amp; user agent detection</h3>
<p>The way that ncurses uses the <code>TERM</code> environment variable to decide which
escape codes to use reminds me of how webservers used to sometimes use the
browser user agent to decide which version of a website to serve.</p>
<p>It also seems like it&rsquo;s had some of the same results &ndash; the way iTerm2 reports
itself as being &ldquo;xterm-256color&rdquo; feels similar to how Safari&rsquo;s user agent is
&ldquo;Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 14_7_4) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML,
like Gecko) Version/18.3 Safari/605.1.15&rdquo;. In both cases the terminal emulator
/ browser ends up changing its user agent to get around user agent detection
that isn&rsquo;t working well.</p>
<p>On the web we ended up deciding that user agent detection was not a good
practice and to instead focus on standardization so we can serve the same
HTML/CSS to all browsers. I don&rsquo;t know if the same approach is the future in
the terminal though &ndash; I think the terminal landscape today is much more
fragmented than the web ever was as well as being much less well funded.</p>
<h3 id="some-more-documents-standards">some more documents/standards</h3>
<p>A few more documents and standards related to escape codes, in no particular order:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man4/console_codes.4.html">Linux console_codes man page</a> documents
escape codes that Linux supports</li>
<li>how the <a href="https://vt100.net/docs/vt100-ug/chapter3.html">VT 100</a> handles escape codes &amp; control sequences</li>
<li>the <a href="https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/keyboard-protocol/">kitty keyboard protocol</a></li>
<li><a href="https://gist.github.com/egmontkob/eb114294efbcd5adb1944c9f3cb5feda">OSC 8</a> for links in the terminal (and notes on <a href="https://github.com/Alhadis/OSC8-Adoption?tab=readme-ov-file">adoption</a>)</li>
<li>A <a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux/blob/882fb4d295deb3e4b803eb444915763305114e4f/tools/ansicode.txt">summary of ANSI standards from tmux</a></li>
<li>this <a href="https://iterm2.com/feature-reporting/">terminal features reporting specification from iTerm</a></li>
<li>sixel graphics</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-i-think-this-is-interesting">why I think this is interesting</h3>
<p>I sometimes see people saying that the unix terminal is &ldquo;outdated&rdquo;, and since I
love the terminal so much I&rsquo;m always curious about what incremental changes
might make it feel less &ldquo;outdated&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Maybe if we had a clearer standards landscape (like we do on the web!) it would
be easier for terminal emulator developers to build new features and for
authors of terminal applications to more confidently adopt those features so
that we can all benefit from them and have a richer experience in the terminal.</p>
<p>Obviously standardizing ANSI escape codes is not easy (ECMA-48 was first
published almost 50 years ago and we&rsquo;re still not there!). I don&rsquo;t even know
what all of the challenges are. But the situation with HTML/CSS/JS used to be
extremely bad too and now it&rsquo;s MUCH better, so maybe there&rsquo;s hope.</p>

### [How to add a directory to your PATH](https://jvns.ca/blog/2025/02/13/how-to-add-a-directory-to-your-path/)

**来源**: Julia Evans

**摘要**: <p>I was talking to a friend about how to add a directory to your PATH today. It&rsquo;s
something that feels &ldquo;obvious&rdquo; to me since I&rsquo;ve been using the terminal for a
long time, but when I searched for instructions for how to do it, I actually
couldn&rsquo;t find something that explained all of the steps &ndash; a lot of them just
said &ldquo;add this to <code>~/.bashrc</code>&rdquo;, but what if you&rsquo;re not using bash? What if your
bash config is actually in a different file? And how are you supposed to figure
out which directory to add anyway?</p>
<p>So I wanted to try to write down some more complete directions and mention some

</ul>

</ul>
<h3 id="step-1-what-shell-are-you-using">step 1: what shell are you using?</h3>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not sure what shell you&rsquo;re using, here&rsquo;s a way to find out. Run this:</p>
<pre><code>ps -p $$ -o pid,comm=
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>if you&rsquo;re using <strong>bash</strong>, it&rsquo;ll print out <code>97295 bash</code></li>
<li>if you&rsquo;re using <strong>zsh</strong>, it&rsquo;ll print out <code>97295 zsh</code></li>
<li>if you&rsquo;re using <strong>fish</strong>, it&rsquo;ll print out an error like &ldquo;In fish, please use
$fish_pid&rdquo; (<code>$$</code> isn&rsquo;t valid syntax in fish, but in any case the error
message tells you that you&rsquo;re using fish, which you probably already knew)</li>
</ul>
<p>Also bash is the default on Linux and zsh is the default on Mac OS (as of
2024). I&rsquo;ll only cover bash, zsh, and fish in these directions.</p>
<h3 id="step-2-find-your-shell-s-config-file">step 2: find your shell&rsquo;s config file</h3>
<ul>
<li>in zsh, it&rsquo;s probably <code>~/.zshrc</code></li>
<li>in bash, it might be <code>~/.bashrc</code>, but it&rsquo;s complicated, see the note in the next section</li>
<li>in fish, it&rsquo;s probably <code>~/.config/fish/config.fish</code> (you can run <code>echo $__fish_config_dir</code> if you want to be 100% sure)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="a-note-on-bash-s-config-file">a note on bash&rsquo;s config file</h3>
<p>Bash has three possible config files: <code>~/.bashrc</code>, <code>~/.bash_profile</code>, and <code>~/.profile</code>.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not sure which one your system is set up to use, I&rsquo;d recommend
testing this way:</p>
<ol>
<li>add <code>echo hi there</code> to your <code>~/.bashrc</code></li>
<li>Restart your terminal</li>
<li>If you see &ldquo;hi there&rdquo;, that means <code>~/.bashrc</code> is being used! Hooray!</li>
<li>Otherwise remove it and try the same thing with <code>~/.bash_profile</code></li>
<li>You can also try <code>~/.profile</code> if the first two options don&rsquo;t work.</li>
</ol>
<p>(there are a lot of <a href="https://blog.flowblok.id.au/2013-02/shell-startup-scripts.html">elaborate flow charts</a> out there that explain how bash
decides which config file to use but IMO it&rsquo;s not worth it to internalize them
and just testing is the fastest way to be sure)</p>
<h3 id="step-3-figure-out-which-directory-to-add">step 3: figure out which directory to add</h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say that you&rsquo;re trying to install and run a program called <code>http-server</code>
and it doesn&rsquo;t work, like this:</p>
<pre><code>$ npm install -g http-server
$ http-server
bash: http-server: command not found
</code></pre>
<p>How do you find what directory <code>http-server</code> is in? Honestly in general this is
not that easy &ndash; often the answer is something like &ldquo;it depends on how npm is
configured&rdquo;. A few ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Often when setting up a new installer (like <code>cargo</code>, <code>npm</code>, <code>homebrew</code>, etc),
when you first set it up it&rsquo;ll print out some directions about how to update
your PATH. So if you&rsquo;re paying attention you can get the directions then.</li>
<li>Sometimes installers will automatically update your shell&rsquo;s config file
to update your <code>PATH</code> for you</li>
<li>Sometimes just Googling &ldquo;where does npm install things?&rdquo; will turn up the
answer</li>
<li>Some tools have a subcommand that tells you where they&rsquo;re configured to
install things, like:
<ul>
<li>Node/npm: <code>npm config get prefix</code> (then append <code>/bin/</code>)</li>
<li>Go: <code>go env GOPATH</code> (then append <code>/bin/</code>)</li>
<li>asdf: <code>asdf info | grep ASDF_DIR</code> (then append <code>/bin/</code> and <code>/shims/</code>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-3-1-double-check-it-s-the-right-directory">step 3.1: double check it&rsquo;s the right directory</h3>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve found a directory you think might be the right one, make sure it&rsquo;s
actually correct! For example, I found out that on my machine, <code>http-server</code> is
in <code>~/.npm-global/bin</code>. I can make sure that it&rsquo;s the right directory by trying to
run the program <code>http-server</code> in that directory like this:</p>
<pre><code>$ ~/.npm-global/bin/http-server
Starting up http-server, serving ./public
</code></pre>
<p>It worked! Now that you know what directory you need to add to your <code>PATH</code>,
let&rsquo;s move to the next step!</p>
<h3 id="step-4-edit-your-shell-config">step 4: edit your shell config</h3>
<p>Now we have the 2 critical pieces of information we need:</p>
<ol>
<li>Which directory you&rsquo;re trying to add to your PATH (like  <code>~/.npm-global/bin/</code>)</li>
<li>Where your shell&rsquo;s config is (like <code>~/.bashrc</code>, <code>~/.zshrc</code>, or <code>~/.config/fish/config.fish</code>)</li>
</ol>
<p>Now what you need to add depends on your shell:</p>
<p><strong>bash instructions:</strong></p>
<p>Open your shell&rsquo;s config file, and add a line like this:</p>
<pre><code>export PATH=$PATH:~/.npm-global/bin/
</code></pre>
<p>(obviously replace <code>~/.npm-global/bin</code> with the actual directory you&rsquo;re trying to add)</p>
<p><strong>zsh instructions:</strong></p>
<p>You can do the same thing as in bash, but zsh also has some slightly fancier
syntax you can use if you prefer:</p>
<pre><code>path=(
  $path
  ~/.npm-global/bin
)
</code></pre>
<p><strong>fish instructions:</strong></p>
<p>In fish, the syntax is different:</p>
<pre><code>set PATH $PATH ~/.npm-global/bin
</code></pre>
<p>(in fish you can also use <code>fish_add_path</code>, some notes on that <a href="https://jvns.ca/atom.xml#a-note-on-fish-add-path">further down</a>)</p>
<h3 id="step-5-restart-your-shell">step 5: restart your shell</h3>
<p>Now, an extremely important step: updating your shell&rsquo;s config won&rsquo;t take
effect if you don&rsquo;t restart it!</p>
<p>Two ways to do this:</p>
<ol>
<li>open a new terminal (or terminal tab), and maybe close the old one so you don&rsquo;t get confused</li>
<li>Run <code>bash</code> to start a new shell (or <code>zsh</code> if you&rsquo;re using zsh, or <code>fish</code> if you&rsquo;re using fish)</li>
</ol>
<p>I&rsquo;ve found that both of these usually work fine.</p>
<p>And you should be done! Try running the program you were trying to run and
hopefully it works now.</p>
<p>If not, here are a couple of problems that you might run into:</p>
<h3 id="problem-1-it-ran-the-wrong-program">problem 1: it ran the wrong program</h3>
<p>If the wrong <strong>version</strong> of a program is running, you might need to add the
directory to the <em>beginning</em> of your PATH instead of the end.</p>
<p>For example, on my system I have two versions of <code>python3</code> installed, which I
can see by running <code>which -a</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ which -a python3
/usr/bin/python3
/opt/homebrew/bin/python3
</code></pre>
<p>The one your shell will use is the <strong>first one listed</strong>.</p>
<p>If you want to use the Homebrew version, you need to add that directory
(<code>/opt/homebrew/bin</code>) to the <strong>beginning</strong> of your PATH instead, by putting this in
your shell&rsquo;s config file (it&rsquo;s <code>/opt/homebrew/bin/:$PATH</code> instead of the usual <code>$PATH:/opt/homebrew/bin/</code>)</p>
<pre><code>export PATH=/opt/homebrew/bin/:$PATH
</code></pre>
<p>or in fish:</p>
<pre><code>set PATH ~/.cargo/bin $PATH
</code></pre>
<h3 id="problem-2-the-program-isn-t-being-run-from-your-shell">problem 2: the program isn&rsquo;t being run from your shell</h3>
<p>All of these directions only work if you&rsquo;re running the program <strong>from your
shell</strong>. If you&rsquo;re running the program from an IDE, from a GUI, in a cron job,
or some other way, you&rsquo;ll need to add the directory to your PATH in a different
way, and the exact details might depend on the situation.</p>
<p><strong>in a cron job</strong></p>
<p>Some options:</p>
<ul>
<li>use the full path to the program you&rsquo;re running, like <code>/home/bork/bin/my-program</code></li>
<li>put the full PATH you want as the first line of your crontab (something like
PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:&hellip;.). You can get the full PATH you&rsquo;re
using in your shell by running <code>echo &quot;PATH=$PATH&quot;</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m honestly not sure how to handle it in an IDE/GUI because I haven&rsquo;t run into
that in a long time, will add directions here if someone points me in the right
direction.</p>
<h3 id="problem-3-duplicate-path-entries-making-it-harder-to-debug">problem 3: duplicate <code>PATH</code> entries making it harder to debug</h3>
<p>If you edit your path and start a new shell by running <code>bash</code> (or <code>zsh</code>, or
<code>fish</code>), you&rsquo;ll often end up with duplicate <code>PATH</code> entries, because the shell
keeps adding new things to your <code>PATH</code> every time you start your shell.</p>
<p>Personally I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve run into a situation where this kind of
duplication breaks anything, but the duplicates can make it harder to debug
what&rsquo;s going on with your <code>PATH</code> if you&rsquo;re trying to understand its contents.</p>
<p>Some ways you could deal with this:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you&rsquo;re debugging your <code>PATH</code>, open a new terminal to do it in so you get
a &ldquo;fresh&rdquo; state. This should avoid the duplication.</li>
<li>Deduplicate your <code>PATH</code> at the end of your shell&rsquo;s config  (for example in
zsh apparently you can do this with <code>typeset -U path</code>)</li>
<li>Check that the directory isn&rsquo;t already in your <code>PATH</code> when adding it (for
example in fish I believe you can do this with <code>fish_add_path --path /some/directory</code>)</li>
</ol>
<p>How to deduplicate your <code>PATH</code> is shell-specific and there isn&rsquo;t always a
built in way to do it so you&rsquo;ll need to look up how to accomplish it in your
shell.</p>
<h3 id="problem-4-losing-your-history-after-updating-your-path">problem 4: losing your history after updating your <code>PATH</code></h3>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a situation that&rsquo;s easy to get into in bash or zsh:</p>
<ol>
<li>Run a command (it fails)</li>
<li>Update your <code>PATH</code></li>
<li>Run <code>bash</code> to reload your config</li>
<li>Press the up arrow a couple of times to rerun the failed command (or open a new terminal)</li>
<li>The failed command isn&rsquo;t in your history! Why not?</li>
</ol>
<p>This happens because in bash, by default, history is not saved until you exit
the shell.</p>
<p>Some options for fixing this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of running <code>bash</code> to reload your config, run <code>source ~/.bashrc</code> (or
<code>source ~/.zshrc</code> in zsh). This will reload the config inside your current
session.</li>
<li>Configure your shell to continuously save your history instead of only saving
the history when the shell exits. (How to do this depends on whether you&rsquo;re
using bash or zsh, the history options in zsh are a bit complicated and I&rsquo;m
not exactly sure what the best way is)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="a-note-on-source">a note on <code>source</code></h3>
<p>When you install <code>cargo</code> (Rust&rsquo;s installer) for the first time, it gives you
these instructions for how to set up your PATH, which don&rsquo;t mention a specific
directory at all.</p>
<pre><code>This is usually done by running one of the following (note the leading DOT):

. &quot;$HOME/.cargo/env&quot;        	# For sh/bash/zsh/ash/dash/pdksh
source &quot;$HOME/.cargo/env.fish&quot;  # For fish
</code></pre>
<p>The idea is that you add that line to your shell&rsquo;s config, and their script
automatically sets up your <code>PATH</code> (and potentially other things) for you.</p>
<p>This is pretty common (for example <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/install/blob/deacfa6a6e62e5f4002baf9e1fac7a96e9aa5d41/install.sh#L1072-L1087">Homebrew</a> suggests you eval <code>brew shellenv</code>), and there are
two ways to approach this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Just do what the tool suggests (like adding <code>. &quot;$HOME/.cargo/env&quot;</code> to your shell&rsquo;s config)</li>
<li>Figure out which directories the script they&rsquo;re telling you to run would add
to your PATH, and then add those manually. Here&rsquo;s how I&rsquo;d do that:
<ul>
<li>Run <code>. &quot;$HOME/.cargo/env&quot;</code> in my shell (or the fish version if using fish)</li>
<li>Run <code>echo &quot;$PATH&quot; | tr ':' '\n' | grep cargo</code> to figure out which directories it added</li>
<li>See that it says <code>/Users/bork/.cargo/bin</code> and shorten that to <code>~/.cargo/bin</code></li>
<li>Add the directory <code>~/.cargo/bin</code> to PATH (with the directions in this post)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s anything wrong with doing what the tool suggests (it
might be the &ldquo;best way&rdquo;!), but personally I usually use the second approach
because I prefer knowing exactly what configuration I&rsquo;m changing.</p>
<h3 id="a-note-on-fish-add-path">a note on <code>fish_add_path</code></h3>
<p>fish has a handy function called <code>fish_add_path</code> that you can run to add a directory to your <code>PATH</code> like this:</p>
<pre><code>fish_add_path /some/directory
</code></pre>
<p>This is cool (it&rsquo;s such a simple command!) but I&rsquo;ve stopped using it for a couple of reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sometimes <code>fish_add_path</code> will update the <code>PATH</code> for every session in the
future (with a &ldquo;universal variable&rdquo;) and sometimes it will update the <code>PATH</code>
just for the current session and it&rsquo;s hard for me to tell which one it will
do. In theory the docs explain this but I could not understand them.</li>
<li>If you ever need to <em>remove</em> the directory from your <code>PATH</code> a few weeks or
months later because maybe you made a mistake, it&rsquo;s kind of hard to do
(there are <a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8604">instructions in this comments of this github issue though</a>).</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="that-s-all">that&rsquo;s all</h3>
<p>Hopefully this will help some people. Let me know (on Mastodon or Bluesky) if
you there are other major gotchas that have tripped you up when adding a
directory to your PATH, or if you have questions about this post!</p>

### [Some terminal frustrations](https://jvns.ca/blog/2025/02/05/some-terminal-frustrations/)

**来源**: Julia Evans

**摘要**: <p>A few weeks ago I ran a terminal survey (you can <a href="https://jvns.ca/terminal-survey/results-bsky.html">read the results here</a>) and at the end I asked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What’s the most frustrating thing about using the terminal for you?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>1600 people answered, and I decided to spend a few days categorizing all the
responses. Along the way I learned that classifying qualitative data is not
easy but I gave it my best shot. I ended up building a custom
<a href="https://github.com/jvns/classificator">tool</a> to make it faster to categorize
everything.</p>
<p>As with all of my surveys the methodology isn&rsquo;t particularly scientific. I just
posted the survey to Mastodon and Twitter, ran it for a couple of days, and got
answers from whoever happened to see it and felt like responding.</p>
<p>Here are the top categories of frustrations!</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s worth keeping in mind while reading these comments that</p>
<ul>
<li>40% of people answering this survey have been using the terminal for <strong>21+ years</strong></li>
<li>95% of people answering the survey have been using the terminal for at least 4 years</li>
</ul>
<p>These comments aren&rsquo;t coming from total beginners.</p>
<p>Here are the categories of frustrations! The number in brackets is the number
of people with that frustration. I&rsquo;m mostly writing this up for myself because
I&rsquo;m trying to write a zine about the terminal and I wanted to get a sense for
what people are having trouble with.</p>
<h3 id="remembering-syntax-115">remembering syntax (115)</h3>
<p>People talked about struggles remembering:</p>
<ul>
<li>the syntax for CLI tools like awk, jq, sed, etc</li>
<li>the syntax for redirects</li>
<li>keyboard shortcuts for tmux, text editing, etc</li>
</ul>
<p>One example comment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are just so many little &ldquo;trivia&rdquo; details to remember for full
functionality. Even after all these years I&rsquo;ll sometimes forget where it&rsquo;s 2
or 1 for stderr, or forget which is which for <code>&gt;</code> and <code>&gt;&gt;</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="switching-terminals-is-hard-91">switching terminals is hard (91)</h3>
<p>People talked about struggling with switching systems (for example home/work
computer or when SSHing) and running into:</p>
<ul>
<li>OS differences in keyboard shortcuts (like Linux vs Mac)</li>
<li>systems which don&rsquo;t have their preferred text editor (&ldquo;no vim&rdquo; or &ldquo;only vim&rdquo;)</li>
<li>different versions of the same command (like Mac OS grep vs GNU grep)</li>
<li>no tab completion</li>
<li>a shell they aren&rsquo;t used to (&ldquo;the subtle differences between zsh and bash&rdquo;)</li>
</ul>
<p>as well as differences inside the same system like pagers being not consistent
with each other (git diff pagers, other pagers).</p>
<p>One example comment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I got used to fish and vi mode which are not available when I ssh into
servers, containers.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="color-85">color (85)</h3>
<p>Lots of problems with color, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>programs setting colors that are unreadable with a light background color</li>
<li>finding a colorscheme they like (and getting it to work consistently across different apps)</li>
<li>color not working inside several layers of SSH/tmux/etc</li>
<li>not liking the defaults</li>
<li>not wanting color at all and struggling to turn it off</li>
</ul>
<p>This comment felt relatable to me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Getting my terminal theme configured in a reasonable way between the terminal
emulator and fish (I did this years ago and remember it being tedious and
fiddly and now feel like I&rsquo;m locked into my current theme because it works
and I dread touching any of that configuration ever again).</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="keyboard-shortcuts-84">keyboard shortcuts (84)</h3>
<p>Half of the comments on keyboard shortcuts were about how on Linux/Windows, the
keyboard shortcut to copy/paste in the terminal is different from in the rest
of the OS.</p>
<p>Some other issues with keyboard shortcuts other than copy/paste:</p>
<ul>
<li>using <code>Ctrl-W</code> in a browser-based terminal and closing the window</li>
<li>the terminal only supports a limited set of keyboard shortcuts (no
<code>Ctrl-Shift-</code>, no <code>Super</code>, no <code>Hyper</code>, lots of <code>ctrl-</code> shortcuts aren&rsquo;t
possible like <code>Ctrl-,</code>)</li>
<li>the OS stopping you from using a terminal keyboard shortcut (like by default
Mac OS uses <code>Ctrl+left arrow</code> for something else)</li>
<li>issues using emacs in the terminal</li>
<li>backspace not working (2)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="other-copy-and-paste-issues-75">other copy and paste issues (75)</h3>
<p>Aside from &ldquo;the keyboard shortcut for copy and paste is different&rdquo;, there were
a lot of OTHER issues with copy and paste, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>copying over SSH</li>
<li>how tmux and the terminal emulator both do copy/paste in different ways</li>
<li>dealing with many different clipboards (system clipboard, vim clipboard, the
&ldquo;middle click&rdquo; clipboard on Linux, tmux&rsquo;s clipboard, etc) and potentially
synchronizing them</li>
<li>random spaces added when copying from the terminal</li>
<li>pasting multiline commands which automatically get run in a terrifying way</li>
<li>wanting a way to copy text without using the mouse</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="discoverability-55">discoverability (55)</h3>
<p>There were lots of comments about this, which all came down to the same basic
complaint &ndash; it&rsquo;s hard to discover useful tools or features! This comment kind of
summed it all up:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How difficult it is to learn independently. Most of what I know is an
assorted collection of stuff I&rsquo;ve been told by random people over the years.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="steep-learning-curve-44">steep learning curve (44)</h3>
<p>A lot of comments about it generally having a steep learning curve. A couple of
example comments:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After 15 years of using it, I’m not much faster than using it than I was 5 or
maybe even 10 years ago.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That I know I could make my life easier by learning more about the shortcuts
and commands and configuring the terminal but I don&rsquo;t spend the time because it
feels overwhelming.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="history-42">history  (42)</h3>
<p>Some issues with shell history:</p>
<ul>
<li>history not being shared between terminal tabs (16)</li>
<li>limits that are too short (4)</li>
<li>history not being restored when terminal tabs are restored</li>
<li>losing history because the terminal crashed</li>
<li>not knowing how to search history</li>
</ul>
<p>One example comment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It wasted a lot of time until I figured it out and still annoys me that
&ldquo;history&rdquo; on zsh has such a small buffer;  I have to type &ldquo;history 0&rdquo; to get
any useful length of history.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="bad-documentation-37">bad documentation (37)</h3>
<p>People talked about:</p>
<ul>
<li>documentation being generally opaque</li>
<li>lack of examples in man pages</li>
<li>programs which don&rsquo;t have man pages</li>
</ul>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a representative comment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Finding good examples and docs. Man pages often not enough, have to wade
through stack overflow</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="scrollback-36">scrollback (36)</h3>
<p>A few issues with scrollback:</p>
<ul>
<li>programs printing out too much data making you lose scrollback history</li>
<li>resizing the terminal messes up the scrollback</li>
<li>lack of timestamps</li>
<li>GUI programs that you start in the background printing stuff out that gets in
the way of other programs&rsquo; outputs</li>
</ul>
<p>One example comment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When resizing the terminal (in particular: making it narrower) leads to
broken rewrapping of the scrollback content because the commands formatted
their output based on the terminal window width.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="it-feels-outdated-33">&ldquo;it feels outdated&rdquo; (33)</h3>
<p>Lots of comments about how the terminal feels hampered by legacy decisions and
how users often end up needing to learn implementation details that feel very
esoteric. One example comment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most of the legacy cruft, it would be great to have a green field
implementation of the CLI interface.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="shell-scripting-32">shell scripting (32)</h3>
<p>Lots of complaints about POSIX shell scripting. There&rsquo;s a general feeling that
shell scripting is difficult but also that switching to a different less
standard scripting language (fish, nushell, etc) brings its own problems.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shell scripting. My tolerance to ditch a shell script and go to a scripting
language is pretty low. It’s just too messy and powerful. Screwing up can be
costly so I don’t even bother.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="more-issues">more issues</h3>
<p>Some more issues that were mentioned at least 10 times:</p>
<ul>
<li>(31) inconsistent command line arguments: is it -h or help or &ndash;help?</li>
<li>(24) keeping dotfiles in sync across different systems</li>
<li>(23) performance (e.g. &ldquo;my shell takes too long to start&rdquo;)</li>
<li>(20) window management (potentially with some combination of tmux tabs, terminal tabs, and multiple terminal windows. Where did that shell session go?)</li>
<li>(17) generally feeling scared/uneasy (&ldquo;The debilitating fear that I’m going
to do some mysterious Bad Thing with a command and I will have absolutely no
idea how to fix or undo it or even really figure out what happened&rdquo;)</li>
<li>(16) terminfo issues (&ldquo;Having to learn about terminfo if/when I try a new terminal emulator and ssh elsewhere.&rdquo;)</li>
<li>(16) lack of image support (sixel etc)</li>
<li>(15) SSH issues (like having to start over when you lose the SSH connection)</li>
<li>(15) various tmux/screen issues (for example lack of integration between tmux and the terminal emulator)</li>
<li>(15) typos &amp; slow typing</li>
<li>(13) the terminal getting messed up for various reasons (pressing <code>Ctrl-S</code>, <code>cat</code>ing a binary, etc)</li>
<li>(12) quoting/escaping in the shell</li>
<li>(11) various Windows/PowerShell issues</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="n-a-122">n/a (122)</h3>
<p>There were also 122 answers to the effect of &ldquo;nothing really&rdquo; or &ldquo;only that I
can&rsquo;t do EVERYTHING in the terminal&rdquo;</p>
<p>One example comment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Think I&rsquo;ve found work arounds for most/all frustrations</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="that-s-all">that&rsquo;s all!</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to make a lot of commentary on these results, but here are a
couple of categories that feel related to me:</p>
<ul>
<li>remembering syntax &amp; history (often the thing you need to remember is something you&rsquo;ve run before!)</li>
<li>discoverability &amp; the learning curve (the lack of discoverability is definitely a big part of what makes it hard to learn)</li>
<li>&ldquo;switching systems is hard&rdquo; &amp; &ldquo;it feels outdated&rdquo; (tools that haven&rsquo;t really
changed in 30 or 40 years have many problems but they do tend to be always
<em>there</em> no matter what system you&rsquo;re on, which is very useful and makes them
hard to stop using)</li>
</ul>
<p>Trying to categorize all these results in a reasonable way really gave me an
appreciation for social science researchers&rsquo; skills.</p>

### [What's involved in getting a "modern" terminal setup?](https://jvns.ca/blog/2025/01/11/getting-a-modern-terminal-setup/)

**来源**: Julia Evans

**摘要**: <p>Hello! Recently I ran a terminal survey and I asked people what frustrated
them. One person commented:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are so many pieces to having a modern terminal experience. I wish it
all came out of the box.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My immediate reaction was &ldquo;oh, getting a modern terminal experience isn&rsquo;t that
hard, you just need to&hellip;.&rdquo;, but the more I thought about it, the longer the
&ldquo;you just need to&hellip;&rdquo; list got, and I kept thinking about more and more
caveats.</p>
<p>So I thought I would write down some notes about what it means to me personally
to have a &ldquo;modern&rdquo; terminal experience and what I think can make it hard for
people to get there.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-a-modern-terminal-experience">what is a &ldquo;modern terminal experience&rdquo;?</h3>
<p>Here are a few things that are important to me, with which part of the system
is responsible for them:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>multiline support for copy and paste</strong>: if you paste 3 commands in your shell, it should not immediately run them all! That&rsquo;s scary! (<strong>shell</strong>, <strong>terminal emulator</strong>)</li>
<li><strong>infinite shell history</strong>: if I run a command in my shell, it should be saved forever, not deleted after 500 history entries or whatever. Also I want commands to be saved to the history immediately when I run them, not only when I exit the shell session (<strong>shell</strong>)</li>
<li><strong>a useful prompt</strong>: I can&rsquo;t live without having my <strong>current directory</strong> and <strong>current git branch</strong> in my prompt (<strong>shell</strong>)</li>
<li><strong>24-bit colour</strong>: this is important to me because I find it MUCH easier to theme neovim with 24-bit colour support than in a terminal with only 256 colours (<strong>terminal emulator</strong>)</li>
<li><strong>clipboard integration</strong> between vim and my operating system so that when I copy in Firefox, I can just press <code>p</code> in vim to paste (<strong>text editor</strong>, maybe the OS/terminal emulator too)</li>
<li><strong>good autocomplete</strong>: for example commands like git should have command-specific autocomplete (<strong>shell</strong>)</li>
<li><strong>having colours in <code>ls</code></strong> (<strong>shell config</strong>)</li>
<li><strong>a terminal theme I like</strong>: I spend a lot of time in my terminal, I want it to look nice and I want its theme to match my terminal editor&rsquo;s theme. (<strong>terminal emulator</strong>, <strong>text editor</strong>)</li>
<li><strong>automatic terminal fixing</strong>: If a programs prints out some weird escape
codes that mess up my terminal, I want that to automatically get reset so
that my terminal doesn&rsquo;t get messed up (<strong>shell</strong>)</li>
<li><strong>keybindings</strong>: I want <code>Ctrl+left arrow</code> to work (<strong>shell</strong> or <strong>application</strong>)</li>
<li><strong>being able to use the scroll wheel in programs like <code>less</code></strong>: (<strong>terminal emulator</strong> and <strong>applications</strong>)</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a million other terminal conveniences out there and different people
value different things, but those are the ones that I would be really unhappy
without.</p>
<h3 id="how-i-achieve-a-modern-experience">how I achieve a &ldquo;modern experience&rdquo;</h3>
<p>My basic approach is:</p>
<ol>
<li>use the <code>fish</code> shell. Mostly don&rsquo;t configure it, except to:
<ul>
<li>set the <code>EDITOR</code> environment variable to my favourite terminal editor</li>
<li>alias <code>ls</code> to <code>ls --color=auto</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>use any terminal emulator with 24-bit colour support. In the past I&rsquo;ve used
GNOME Terminal, Terminator, and iTerm, but I&rsquo;m not picky about this. I don&rsquo;t really
configure it other than to choose a font.</li>
<li>use <code>neovim</code>, with a configuration that I&rsquo;ve been very slowly building over the last 9 years or so (the last time I deleted my vim config and started from scratch was 9 years ago)</li>
<li>use the <a href="https://github.com/chriskempson/base16">base16 framework</a> to theme everything</li>
</ol>
<p>A few things that affect my approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>I don&rsquo;t spend a lot of time SSHed into other machines</li>
<li>I&rsquo;d rather use the mouse a little than come up with keyboard-based ways to do everything</li>
<li>I work on a lot of small projects, not one big project</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="some-out-of-the-box-options-for-a-modern-experience">some &ldquo;out of the box&rdquo; options for a &ldquo;modern&rdquo; experience</h3>
<p>What if you want a nice experience, but don&rsquo;t want to spend a lot of time on
configuration? Figuring out how to configure vim in a way that I was satisfied
with really did take me like ten years, which is a long time!</p>
<p>My best ideas for how to get a reasonable terminal experience with minimal
config are:</p>
<ul>
<li>shell: either <code>fish</code> or <code>zsh</code> with <a href="https://ohmyz.sh/">oh-my-zsh</a></li>
<li>terminal emulator: almost anything with 24-bit colour support, for example all of these are popular:
<ul>
<li>linux: GNOME Terminal, Konsole, Terminator, xfce4-terminal</li>
<li>mac: iTerm (Terminal.app doesn&rsquo;t have 256-colour support)</li>
<li>cross-platform: kitty, alacritty, wezterm, or ghostty</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>shell config:
<ul>
<li>set the <code>EDITOR</code> environment variable to your favourite terminal text
editor</li>
<li>maybe alias <code>ls</code> to <code>ls --color=auto</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>text editor: this is a tough one, maybe <a href="https://micro-editor.github.io/">micro</a> or <a href="https://helix-editor.com/">helix</a>? I haven&rsquo;t used
either of them seriously but they both seem like very cool projects and I
think it&rsquo;s amazing that you can just use all the usual GUI editor commands
(<code>Ctrl-C</code> to copy, <code>Ctrl-V</code> to paste, <code>Ctrl-A</code> to select all) in micro and
they do what you&rsquo;d expect. I would probably try switching to helix except
that retraining my vim muscle memory seems way too hard. Also helix doesn&rsquo;t
have a GUI or plugin system yet.</li>
</ul>
<p>Personally I <strong>wouldn&rsquo;t</strong> use xterm, rxvt, or Terminal.app as a terminal emulator,
because I&rsquo;ve found in the past that they&rsquo;re missing core features (like 24-bit
colour in Terminal.app&rsquo;s case) that make the terminal harder to use for me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to pretend that getting a &ldquo;modern&rdquo; terminal experience is easier
than it is though &ndash; I think there are two issues that make it hard. Let&rsquo;s talk
about them!</p>
<h3 id="issue-1-with-getting-to-a-modern-experience-the-shell">issue 1 with getting to a &ldquo;modern&rdquo; experience: the shell</h3>
<p>bash and zsh are by far the two most popular shells, and neither of them
provide a default experience that I would be happy using out of the box, for
example:</p>
<ul>
<li>you need to customize your prompt</li>
<li>they don&rsquo;t come with git completions by default, you have to set them up</li>
<li>by default, bash only stores 500 (!) lines of history and (at least on Mac OS)
zsh is only configured to store 2000 lines, which is still not a lot</li>
<li>I find bash&rsquo;s tab completion very frustrating, if there&rsquo;s more than
one match then you can&rsquo;t tab through them</li>
</ul>
<p>And even though <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2024/09/12/reasons-i--still--love-fish/">I love fish</a>, the fact
that it isn&rsquo;t POSIX does make it hard for a lot of folks to make the switch.</p>
<p>Of course it&rsquo;s totally possible to learn how to customize your prompt in bash
or whatever, and it doesn&rsquo;t even need to be that complicated (in bash I&rsquo;d
probably start with something like <code>export PS1='[\u@\h \W$(__git_ps1 &quot; (%s)&quot;)]\$ '</code>, or maybe use <a href="https://starship.rs/">starship</a>).
But each of these &ldquo;not complicated&rdquo; things really does add up and it&rsquo;s
especially tough if you need to keep your config in sync across several
systems.</p>
<p>An extremely popular solution to getting a &ldquo;modern&rdquo; shell experience is
<a href="https://ohmyz.sh/">oh-my-zsh</a>. It seems like a great project and I know a lot
of people use it very happily, but I&rsquo;ve struggled with configuration systems
like that in the past &ndash; it looks like right now the base oh-my-zsh adds about
3000 lines of config, and often I find that having an extra configuration
system makes it harder to debug what&rsquo;s happening when things go wrong. I
personally have a tendency to use the system to add a lot of extra plugins,
make my system slow, get frustrated that it&rsquo;s slow, and then delete it
completely and write a new config from scratch.</p>
<h3 id="issue-2-with-getting-to-a-modern-experience-the-text-editor">issue 2 with getting to a &ldquo;modern&rdquo; experience: the text editor</h3>
<p>In the terminal survey I ran recently, the most popular terminal text editors
by far were <code>vim</code>, <code>emacs</code>, and <code>nano</code>.</p>
<p>I think the main options for terminal text editors are:</p>
<ul>
<li>use vim or emacs and configure it to your liking, you can probably have any
feature you want if you put in the work</li>
<li>use nano and accept that you&rsquo;re going to have a pretty limited experience
(for example I don&rsquo;t think you can select text with the mouse and then &ldquo;cut&rdquo;
it in nano)</li>
<li>use <code>micro</code> or <code>helix</code> which seem to offer a pretty good out-of-the-box
experience, potentially occasionally run into issues with using a less
mainstream text editor</li>
<li>just avoid using a terminal text editor as much as possible, maybe use VSCode, use
VSCode&rsquo;s terminal for all your terminal needs, and mostly never edit files in
the terminal. Or I know a lot of people use <code>code</code> as their <code>EDITOR</code> in the terminal.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="issue-3-individual-applications">issue 3: individual applications</h3>
<p>The last issue is that sometimes individual programs that I use are kind of
annoying. For example on my Mac OS machine, <code>/usr/bin/sqlite3</code> doesn&rsquo;t support
the <code>Ctrl+Left Arrow</code> keyboard shortcut. Fixing this to get a reasonable
terminal experience in SQLite was a little complicated, I had to:</p>
<ul>
<li>realize why this is happening (Mac OS won&rsquo;t ship GNU tools, and &ldquo;Ctrl-Left arrow&rdquo; support comes from GNU readline)</li>
<li>find a workaround (install sqlite from homebrew, which does have readline support)</li>
<li>adjust my environment (put Homebrew&rsquo;s sqlite3 in my PATH)</li>
</ul>
<p>I find that debugging application-specific issues like this is really not easy
and often it doesn&rsquo;t feel &ldquo;worth it&rdquo; &ndash; often I&rsquo;ll end up just dealing with
various minor inconveniences because I don&rsquo;t want to spend hours investigating
them. The only reason I was even able to figure this one out at all is that
I&rsquo;ve been spending a huge amount of time thinking about the terminal recently.</p>
<p>A big part of having a &ldquo;modern&rdquo; experience using terminal programs is just
using newer terminal programs, for example I can&rsquo;t be bothered to learn a
keyboard shortcut to sort the columns in <code>top</code>, but in <code>htop</code>  I can just click
on a column heading with my mouse to sort it. So I use htop instead! But discovering new more &ldquo;modern&rdquo; command line tools isn&rsquo;t easy (though
I made <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2022/04/12/a-list-of-new-ish--command-line-tools/">a list here</a>),
finding ones that I actually like using in practice takes time, and if you&rsquo;re
SSHed into another machine, they won&rsquo;t always be there.</p>
<h3 id="everything-affects-everything-else">everything affects everything else</h3>
<p>Something I find tricky about configuring my terminal to make everything &ldquo;nice&rdquo;
is that changing one seemingly small thing about my workflow can really affect
everything else. For example right now I don&rsquo;t use tmux. But if I needed to use
tmux again (for example because I was doing a lot of work SSHed into another
machine), I&rsquo;d need to think about a few things, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>if I wanted tmux&rsquo;s copy to synchronize with my system clipboard over
SSH, I&rsquo;d need to make sure that my terminal emulator has <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/k1ydpn/a_guide_on_how_to_copy_text_from_anywhere/">OSC 52 support</a></li>
<li>if I wanted to use iTerm&rsquo;s tmux integration (which makes tmux tabs into iTerm
tabs), I&rsquo;d need to change how I configure colours &ndash; right now I set them
with a <a href="https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-shell/blob/588691ba71b47e75793ed9edfcfaa058326a6f41/scripts/base16-solarized-light.sh">shell script</a> that I run when my shell starts, but that means the
colours get lost when restoring a tmux session.</li>
</ul>
<p>and probably more things I haven&rsquo;t thought of. &ldquo;Using tmux means that I have to
change how I manage my colours&rdquo; sounds unlikely, but that really did happen to
me and I decided &ldquo;well, I don&rsquo;t want to change how I manage colours right now,
so I guess I&rsquo;m not using that feature!&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also hard to remember which features I&rsquo;m relying on &ndash; for example maybe
my current terminal <em>does</em> have OSC 52 support and because copying from tmux over SSH
has always Just Worked I don&rsquo;t even realize that that&rsquo;s something I need, and
then it mysteriously stops working when I switch terminals.</p>
<h3 id="change-things-slowly">change things slowly</h3>
<p>Personally even though I think my setup is not <em>that</em> complicated, it&rsquo;s taken
me 20 years to get to this point! Because terminal config changes are so likely
to have unexpected and hard-to-understand consequences, I&rsquo;ve found that if I
change a lot of terminal configuration all at once it makes it much harder to
understand what went wrong if there&rsquo;s a problem, which can be really
disorienting.</p>
<p>So I usually prefer to make pretty small changes, and accept that changes can
might take me a REALLY long time to get used to. For example I switched from
using <code>ls</code> to <a href="https://github.com/eza-community/eza">eza</a> a year or two ago and
while I like it (because <code>eza -l</code> prints human-readable file sizes by default)
I&rsquo;m still not quite sure about it. But also sometimes it&rsquo;s worth it to make a
big change, like I made the switch to fish (from bash) 10 years ago and I&rsquo;m
very happy I did.</p>
<h3 id="getting-a-modern-terminal-is-not-that-easy">getting a &ldquo;modern&rdquo; terminal is not that easy</h3>
<p>Trying to explain how &ldquo;easy&rdquo; it is to configure your terminal really just made
me think that it&rsquo;s kind of hard and that I still sometimes get confused.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve found that there&rsquo;s never one perfect way to configure things in the
terminal that will be compatible with every single other thing. I just need to
try stuff, figure out some kind of locally stable state that works for me, and
accept that if I start using a new tool it might disrupt the system and I might
need to rethink things.</p>

### ["Rules" that terminal programs follow](https://jvns.ca/blog/2024/11/26/terminal-rules/)

**来源**: Julia Evans

**摘要**: <p>Recently I&rsquo;ve been thinking about how everything that happens in the terminal
is some combination of:</p>
<ol>
<li>Your <strong>operating system</strong>&rsquo;s job</li>
<li>Your <strong>shell</strong>&rsquo;s job</li>
<li>Your <strong>terminal emulator</strong>&rsquo;s job</li>
<li>The job of <strong>whatever program you happen to be running</strong> (like <code>top</code> or <code>vim</code> or <code>cat</code>)</li>
</ol>
<p>The first three (your operating system, shell, and terminal emulator) are all kind of
known quantities &ndash; if you&rsquo;re using bash in GNOME Terminal on Linux, you can
more or less reason about how how all of those things interact, and some of
their behaviour is standardized by POSIX.</p>
<p>But the fourth one (&ldquo;whatever program you happen to be running&rdquo;) feels like it
could do ANYTHING. How are you supposed to know how a program is going to
behave?</p>
<p>This post is kind of long so here&rsquo;s a quick table of contents:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://jvns.ca/atom.xml#programs-behave-surprisingly-consistently">programs behave surprisingly consistently</a></li>

<li><a href="https://jvns.ca/atom.xml#these-rules-take-a-long-time-to-learn">these &ldquo;rules&rdquo; take a long time to learn</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="programs-behave-surprisingly-consistently">programs behave surprisingly consistently</h3>
<p>As far as I know, there are no real standards for how programs in the terminal
should behave &ndash; the closest things I know of are:</p>
<ul>
<li>POSIX, which mostly dictates how your terminal emulator / OS / shell should
work together. I think it does specify a few things about how core utilities like
<code>cp</code> should work but AFAIK it doesn&rsquo;t have anything to say about how for
example <code>htop</code> should behave.</li>
<li>these <a href="https://clig.dev/">command line interface guidelines</a></li>
</ul>
<p>But even though there are no standards, in my experience programs in the
terminal behave in a pretty consistent way. So I wanted to write down a list of
&ldquo;rules&rdquo; that in my experience programs mostly follow.</p>
<h3 id="these-are-meant-to-be-descriptive-not-prescriptive">these are meant to be descriptive, not prescriptive</h3>
<p>My goal here isn&rsquo;t to convince authors of terminal programs that they <em>should</em>
follow any of these rules. There are lots of exceptions to these and often
there&rsquo;s a good reason for those exceptions.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s very useful for me to know what behaviour to expect from a random new
terminal program that I&rsquo;m using. Instead of &ldquo;uh, programs could do literally
anything&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;ok, here are the basic rules I expect, and then I can keep a
short mental list of exceptions&rdquo;.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m just writing down what I&rsquo;ve observed about how programs behave in my 20
years of using the terminal, why I think they behave that way, and some
examples of cases where that rule is &ldquo;broken&rdquo;.</p>
<h3 id="it-s-not-always-obvious-which-rules-are-the-program-s-responsibility-to-implement">it&rsquo;s not always obvious which &ldquo;rules&rdquo; are the program&rsquo;s responsibility to implement</h3>
<p>There are a bunch of common conventions that I think are pretty clearly the
program&rsquo;s responsibility to implement, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>config files should go in <code>~/.BLAHrc</code> or <code>~/.config/BLAH/FILE</code> or <code>/etc/BLAH/</code> or something</li>
<li><code>--help</code> should print help text</li>
<li>programs should print &ldquo;regular&rdquo; output to stdout and errors to stderr</li>
</ul>
<p>But in this post I&rsquo;m going to focus on things that it&rsquo;s not 100% obvious are
the program&rsquo;s responsibility. For example it feels to me like a &ldquo;law of nature&rdquo;
that pressing <code>Ctrl-D</code> should quit a REPL, but programs often
need to explicitly implement support for it &ndash; even though <code>cat</code> doesn&rsquo;t need
to implement <code>Ctrl-D</code> support, <code>ipython</code> <a href="https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit/blob/a2a12300c635ab3c051566e363ed27d853af4b21/src/prompt_toolkit/shortcuts/prompt.py#L824-L837">does</a>. (more about that in &ldquo;rule 3&rdquo; below)</p>
<p>Understanding which things are the program&rsquo;s responsibility makes it much less
surprising when different programs&rsquo; implementations are slightly different.</p>
<h3 id="rule-1-noninteractive-programs-should-quit-when-you-press-ctrl-c">rule 1: noninteractive programs should quit when you press <code>Ctrl-C</code></h3>
<p>The main reason for this rule is that noninteractive programs will quit by
default on <code>Ctrl-C</code> if they don&rsquo;t set up a <code>SIGINT</code> signal handler, so this is
kind of a &ldquo;you should act like the default&rdquo; rule.</p>
<p>Something that trips a lot of people up is that this doesn&rsquo;t apply to
<strong>interactive</strong> programs like <code>python3</code> or <code>bc</code> or <code>less</code>. This is because in
an interactive program, <code>Ctrl-C</code> has a different job &ndash; if the program is
running an operation (like for example a search in <code>less</code> or some Python code
in <code>python3</code>), then <code>Ctrl-C</code> will interrupt that operation but not stop the
program.</p>
<p>As an example of how this works in an interactive program: here&rsquo;s the code <a href="https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit/blob/a2a12300c635ab3c051566e363ed27d853af4b21/src/prompt_toolkit/key_binding/bindings/vi.py#L2225">in prompt-toolkit</a> (the library that iPython uses for handling input)
that aborts a search when you press <code>Ctrl-C</code>.</p>
<h3 id="rule-2-tuis-should-quit-when-you-press-q">rule 2: TUIs should quit when you press <code>q</code></h3>
<p>TUI programs (like <code>less</code> or <code>htop</code>) will usually quit when you press <code>q</code>.</p>
<p>This rule doesn&rsquo;t apply to any program where pressing <code>q</code> to quit wouldn&rsquo;t make
sense, like <code>tmux</code> or text editors.</p>
<h3 id="rule-3-repls-should-quit-when-you-press-ctrl-d-on-an-empty-line">rule 3: REPLs should quit when you press <code>Ctrl-D</code> on an empty line</h3>
<p>REPLs (like <code>python3</code> or <code>ed</code>) will usually quit when you press <code>Ctrl-D</code> on an
empty line. This rule is similar to the <code>Ctrl-C</code> rule &ndash; the reason for this is
that by default if you&rsquo;re running a program (like <code>cat</code>) in &ldquo;cooked mode&rdquo;, then
the operating system will return an <code>EOF</code> when you press <code>Ctrl-D</code> on an empty
line.</p>
<p>Most of the REPLs I use (sqlite3, python3, fish, bash, etc) don&rsquo;t actually use
cooked mode, but they all implement this keyboard shortcut anyway to mimic the
default behaviour.</p>
<p>For example, here&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit/blob/a2a12300c635ab3c051566e363ed27d853af4b21/src/prompt_toolkit/shortcuts/prompt.py#L824-L837">the code in prompt-toolkit</a>
that quits when you press Ctrl-D, and here&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/bminor/bash/blob/6794b5478f660256a1023712b5fc169196ed0a22/lib/readline/readline.c#L658-L672">the same code in readline</a>.</p>
<p>I actually thought that this one was a &ldquo;Law of Terminal Physics&rdquo; until very
recently because I&rsquo;ve basically never seen it broken, but you can see that it&rsquo;s
just something that each individual input library has to implement in the links
above.</p>
<p>Someone pointed out that the Erlang REPL does not quit when you press <code>Ctrl-D</code>,
so I guess not every REPL follows this &ldquo;rule&rdquo;.</p>
<h3 id="rule-4-don-t-use-more-than-16-colours">rule 4: don&rsquo;t use more than 16 colours</h3>
<p>Terminal programs rarely use colours other than the base 16 ANSI colours. This
is because if you specify colours with a hex code, it&rsquo;s very likely to clash
with some users&rsquo; background colour. For example if I print out some text as
<code>#EEEEEE</code>, it would be almost invisible on a white background, though it would
look fine on a dark background.</p>
<p>But if you stick to the default 16 base colours, you have a much better chance
that the user has configured those colours in their terminal emulator so that
they work reasonably well with their background color. Another reason to stick
to the default base 16 colours is that it makes less assumptions about what
colours the terminal emulator supports.</p>
<p>The only programs I usually see breaking this &ldquo;rule&rdquo; are text editors, for
example Helix by default will use a purple background which is not a default
ANSI colour. It seems fine for Helix to break this rule since Helix isn&rsquo;t a
&ldquo;core&rdquo; program and I assume any Helix user who doesn&rsquo;t like that colorscheme
will just change the theme.</p>
<h3 id="rule-5-vaguely-support-readline-keybindings">rule 5: vaguely support readline keybindings</h3>
<p>Almost every program I use supports <code>readline</code> keybindings if it would make
sense to do so. For example, here are a bunch of different programs and a link
to where they define <code>Ctrl-E</code> to go to the end of the line:</p>
<ul>
<li>ipython (<a href="https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit/blob/a2a12300c635ab3c051566e363ed27d853af4b21/src/prompt_toolkit/key_binding/bindings/emacs.py#L72">Ctrl-E defined here</a>)</li>
<li>atuin (<a href="https://github.com/atuinsh/atuin/blob/a67cfc82fe0dc907a01f07a0fd625701e062a33b/crates/atuin/src/command/client/search/interactive.rs#L407">Ctrl-E defined here</a>)</li>
<li>fzf (<a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/blob/bb55045596d6d08445f3c6d320c3ec2b457462d1/src/terminal.go#L611">Ctrl-E defined here</a>)</li>
<li>zsh (<a href="https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh/blob/86d5f24a3d28541f242eb3807379301ea976de87/Src/Zle/zle_bindings.c#L94">Ctrl-E defined here</a>)</li>
<li>fish (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/blob/99fa8aaaa7956178973150a03ce4954ab17a197b/share/functions/fish_default_key_bindings.fish#L43">Ctrl-E defined here</a>)</li>
<li>tmux&rsquo;s command prompt (<a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux/blob/ae8f2208c98e3c2d6e3fe4cad2281dce8fd11f31/key-bindings.c#L490">Ctrl-E defined here</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>None of those programs actually uses <code>readline</code> directly, they just sort of
mimic emacs/readline keybindings. They don&rsquo;t always mimic them <em>exactly</em>: for
example atuin seems to use <code>Ctrl-A</code> as a prefix, so <code>Ctrl-A</code> doesn&rsquo;t go to the
beginning of the line.</p>
<p>Also all of these programs seem to implement their own internal cut and paste
buffers so you can delete a line with <code>Ctrl-U</code> and then paste it with <code>Ctrl-Y</code>.</p>
<p>The exceptions to this are:</p>
<ul>
<li>some programs (like <code>git</code>, <code>cat</code>, and <code>nc</code>) don&rsquo;t have any line editing support at all (except for backspace, <code>Ctrl-W</code>, and <code>Ctrl-U</code>)</li>
<li>as usual text editors are an exception, every text editor has its own
approach to editing text</li>
</ul>
<p>I wrote more about this &ldquo;what keybindings does a program support?&rdquo; question in
<a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2024/07/08/readline/">entering text in the terminal is complicated</a>.</p>
<h3 id="rule-5-1-ctrl-w-should-delete-the-last-word">rule 5.1: Ctrl-W should delete the last word</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never seen a program (other than a text editor) where <code>Ctrl-W</code> <em>doesn&rsquo;t</em>
delete the last word. This is similar to the <code>Ctrl-C</code> rule &ndash; by default if a
program is in &ldquo;cooked mode&rdquo;, the OS will delete the last word if you press
<code>Ctrl-W</code>, and delete the whole line if you press <code>Ctrl-U</code>. So usually programs
will imitate that behaviour.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t think of any exceptions to this other than text editors but if there
are I&rsquo;d love to hear about them!</p>
<h3 id="rule-6-disable-colours-when-writing-to-a-pipe">rule 6: disable colours when writing to a pipe</h3>
<p>Most programs will disable colours when writing to a pipe. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>rg blah</code> will highlight all occurrences of <code>blah</code> in the output, but if the
output is to a pipe or a file, it&rsquo;ll turn off the highlighting.</li>
<li><code>ls --color=auto</code> will use colour when writing to a terminal, but not when
writing to a pipe</li>
</ul>
<p>Both of those programs will also format their output differently when writing
to the terminal: <code>ls</code> will organize files into columns, and ripgrep will group
matches with headings.</p>
<p>If you want to force the program to use colour (for example because you want to
look at the colour), you can use <code>unbuffer</code> to force the program&rsquo;s output to be
a tty like this:</p>
<pre><code>unbuffer rg blah |  less -R
</code></pre>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that there are some programs that &ldquo;break&rdquo; this rule but I can&rsquo;t think
of any examples right now. Some programs have an <code>--color</code> flag that you can
use to force colour to be on, in the example above you could also do <code>rg --color=always | less -R</code>.</p>
<h3 id="rule-7-means-stdin-stdout">rule 7: <code>-</code> means stdin/stdout</h3>
<p>Usually if you pass <code>-</code> to a program instead of a filename, it&rsquo;ll read from
stdin or write to stdout (whichever is appropriate). For example, if you want
to format the Python code that&rsquo;s on your clipboard with <code>black</code> and then copy
it, you could run:</p>
<pre><code>pbpaste | black - | pbcopy
</code></pre>
<p>(<code>pbpaste</code> is a Mac program, you can do something similar on Linux with <code>xclip</code>)</p>
<p>My impression is that most programs implement this if it would make sense and I
can&rsquo;t think of any exceptions right now, but I&rsquo;m sure there are many
exceptions.</p>
<h3 id="these-rules-take-a-long-time-to-learn">these &ldquo;rules&rdquo; take a long time to learn</h3>
<p>These rules took me a long time for me to learn because I had to:</p>
<ol>
<li>learn that the rule applied anywhere at all (&quot;<code>Ctrl-C</code> will exit programs&quot;)</li>
<li>notice some exceptions (&ldquo;okay, <code>Ctrl-C</code> will exit <code>find</code> but not <code>less</code>&rdquo;)</li>
<li>subconsciously figure out what the pattern is (&quot;<code>Ctrl-C</code> will generally quit
noninteractive programs, but in interactive programs it might interrupt the
current operation instead of quitting the program&quot;)</li>
<li>eventually maybe formulate it into an explicit rule that I know</li>
</ol>
<p>A lot of my understanding of the terminal is honestly still in the
&ldquo;subconscious pattern recognition&rdquo; stage. The only reason I&rsquo;ve been taking the
time to make things explicit at all is because I&rsquo;ve been trying to explain how
it works to others. Hopefully writing down these &ldquo;rules&rdquo; explicitly will make
learning some of this stuff a little bit faster for others.</p>

### [Why pipes sometimes get "stuck": buffering](https://jvns.ca/blog/2024/11/29/why-pipes-get-stuck-buffering/)

**来源**: Julia Evans

**摘要**: <p>Here&rsquo;s a niche terminal problem that has bothered me for years but that I never
really understood until a few weeks ago. Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re running this command
to watch for some specific output in a log file:</p>
<pre><code>tail -f /some/log/file | grep thing1 | grep thing2
</code></pre>
<p>If log lines are being added to the file relatively slowly, the result I&rsquo;d see
is&hellip; nothing! It doesn&rsquo;t matter if there were matches in the log file or not,
there just wouldn&rsquo;t be any output.</p>
<p>I internalized this as &ldquo;uh, I guess pipes just get stuck sometimes and don&rsquo;t
show me the output, that&rsquo;s weird&rdquo;, and I&rsquo;d handle it by just
running <code>grep thing1 /some/log/file | grep thing2</code> instead, which would work.</p>
<p>So as I&rsquo;ve been doing a terminal deep dive over the last few months I was
really excited to finally learn exactly why this happens.</p>
<h3 id="why-this-happens-buffering">why this happens: buffering</h3>
<p>The reason why &ldquo;pipes get stuck&rdquo; sometimes is that it&rsquo;s VERY common for
programs to buffer their output before writing it to a pipe or file. So the
pipe is working fine, the problem is that the program never even wrote the data
to the pipe!</p>
<p>This is for performance reasons: writing all output immediately as soon as you
can uses more system calls, so it&rsquo;s more efficient to save up data until you
have 8KB or so of data to write (or until the program exits) and THEN write it
to the pipe.</p>
<p>In this example:</p>
<pre><code>tail -f /some/log/file | grep thing1 | grep thing2
</code></pre>
<p>the problem is that <code>grep thing1</code> is saving up all of its matches until it has
8KB of data to write, which might literally never happen.</p>
<h3 id="programs-don-t-buffer-when-writing-to-a-terminal">programs don&rsquo;t buffer when writing to a terminal</h3>
<p>Part of why I found this so disorienting is that <code>tail -f file | grep thing</code>
will work totally fine, but then when you add the second <code>grep</code>, it stops
working!! The reason for this is that the way <code>grep</code> handles buffering depends
on whether it&rsquo;s writing to a terminal or not.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how <code>grep</code> (and many other programs) decides to buffer its output:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check if stdout is a terminal or not using the <code>isatty</code> function
<ul>
<li>If it&rsquo;s a terminal, use line buffering (print every line immediately as soon as you have it)</li>
<li>Otherwise, use &ldquo;block buffering&rdquo; &ndash; only print data if you have at least 8KB or so of data to print</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So if <code>grep</code> is writing directly to your terminal then you&rsquo;ll see the line as
soon as it&rsquo;s printed, but if it&rsquo;s writing to a pipe, you won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Of course the buffer size isn&rsquo;t always 8KB for every program, it depends on the implementation. For <code>grep</code> the buffering is handled by libc, and libc&rsquo;s buffer size is
defined in the <code>BUFSIZ</code> variable. <a href="https://github.com/bminor/glibc/blob/c69e8cccaff8f2d89cee43202623b33e6ef5d24a/libio/stdio.h#L100">Here&rsquo;s where that&rsquo;s defined in glibc</a>.</p>
<p>(as an aside: &ldquo;programs do not use 8KB output buffers when writing to a
terminal&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t, like, a law of terminal physics, a program COULD use an 8KB
buffer when writing output to a terminal if it wanted, it would just be
extremely weird if it did that, I can&rsquo;t think of any program that behaves that
way)</p>
<h3 id="commands-that-buffer-commands-that-don-t">commands that buffer &amp; commands that don&rsquo;t</h3>
<p>One annoying thing about this buffering behaviour is that you kind of need to
remember which commands buffer their output when writing to a pipe.</p>
<p>Some commands that <strong>don&rsquo;t</strong> buffer their output:</p>
<ul>
<li>tail</li>
<li>cat</li>
<li>tee</li>
</ul>
<p>I think almost everything else will buffer output, especially if it&rsquo;s a command
where you&rsquo;re likely to be using it for batch processing. Here&rsquo;s a list of some
common commands that buffer their output when writing to a pipe, along with the
flag that disables block buffering.</p>
<ul>
<li>grep (<code>--line-buffered</code>)</li>
<li>sed (<code>-u</code>)</li>
<li>awk (there&rsquo;s a <code>fflush()</code> function)</li>
<li>tcpdump (<code>-l</code>)</li>
<li>jq (<code>-u</code>)</li>
<li>tr (<code>-u</code>)</li>
<li>cut (can&rsquo;t disable buffering)</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are all the ones I can think of, lots of unix commands (like <code>sort</code>) may
or may not buffer their output but it doesn&rsquo;t matter because <code>sort</code> can&rsquo;t do
anything until it finishes receiving input anyway.</p>
<p>Also I did my best to test both the Mac OS and GNU versions of these but there
are a lot of variations and I might have made some mistakes.</p>
<h3 id="programming-languages-where-the-default-print-statement-buffers">programming languages where the default &ldquo;print&rdquo; statement buffers</h3>
<p>Also, here are a few programming language where the default print statement
will buffer output when writing to a pipe, and some ways to disable buffering
if you want:</p>
<ul>
<li>C (disable with <code>setvbuf</code>)</li>
<li>Python (disable with <code>python -u</code>, or <code>PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1</code>, or <code>sys.stdout.reconfigure(line_buffering=False)</code>, or <code>print(x, flush=True)</code>)</li>
<li>Ruby (disable with <code>STDOUT.sync = true</code>)</li>
<li>Perl (disable with <code>$| = 1</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>I assume that these languages are designed this way so that the default print
function will be fast when you&rsquo;re doing batch processing.</p>
<p>Also whether output is buffered or not might depend on how you print, for
example in C++ <code>cout &lt;&lt; &quot;hello\n&quot;</code> buffers when writing to a pipe but <code>cout &lt;&lt; &quot;hello&quot; &lt;&lt; endl</code> will flush its output.</p>
<h3 id="when-you-press-ctrl-c-on-a-pipe-the-contents-of-the-buffer-are-lost">when you press <code>Ctrl-C</code> on a pipe, the contents of the buffer are lost</h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re running this command as a hacky way to watch for DNS requests
to <code>example.com</code>, and you forgot to pass <code>-l</code> to tcpdump:</p>
<pre><code>sudo tcpdump -ni any port 53 | grep example.com
</code></pre>
<p>When you press <code>Ctrl-C</code>, what happens? In a magical perfect world, what I would
<em>want</em> to happen is for <code>tcpdump</code> to flush its buffer, <code>grep</code> would search for
<code>example.com</code>, and I would see all the output I missed.</p>
<p>But in the real world, what happens is that all the programs get killed and the
output in <code>tcpdump</code>&rsquo;s buffer is lost.</p>
<p>I think this problem is probably unavoidable &ndash; I spent a little time with
<code>strace</code> to see how this works and <code>grep</code> receives the <code>SIGINT</code> before
<code>tcpdump</code> anyway so even if <code>tcpdump</code> tried to flush its buffer <code>grep</code> would
already be dead.</p>
<small>
<p>After a little more investigation, there is a workaround: if you find
<code>tcpdump</code>&rsquo;s PID and <code>kill -TERM $PID</code>, then tcpdump will flush the buffer so
you can see the output. That&rsquo;s kind of a pain but I tested it and it seems to
work.</p>
</small>
<h3 id="redirecting-to-a-file-also-buffers">redirecting to a file also buffers</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just pipes, this will also buffer:</p>
<pre><code>sudo tcpdump -ni any port 53 &gt; output.txt
</code></pre>
<p>Redirecting to a file doesn&rsquo;t have the same &ldquo;<code>Ctrl-C</code> will totally destroy the
contents of the buffer&rdquo; problem though &ndash; in my experience it usually behaves
more like you&rsquo;d want, where the contents of the buffer get written to the file
before the program exits. I&rsquo;m not 100% sure whether this is something you can
always rely on or not.</p>
<h3 id="a-bunch-of-potential-ways-to-avoid-buffering">a bunch of potential ways to avoid buffering</h3>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s talk solutions. Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;ve run this command:</p>
<pre><code>tail -f /some/log/file | grep thing1 | grep thing2
</code></pre>
<p>I asked people on Mastodon how they would solve this in practice and there were
5 basic approaches. Here they are:</p>
<h4 id="solution-1-run-a-program-that-finishes-quickly">solution 1: run a program that finishes quickly</h4>
<p>Historically my solution to this has been to just avoid the &ldquo;command writing to
pipe slowly&rdquo; situation completely and instead run a program that will finish quickly
like this:</p>
<pre><code>cat /some/log/file | grep thing1 | grep thing2 | tail
</code></pre>
<p>This doesn&rsquo;t do the same thing as the original command but it does mean that
you get to avoid thinking about these weird buffering issues.</p>
<p>(you could also do <code>grep thing1 /some/log/file</code> but I often prefer to use an
&ldquo;unnecessary&rdquo; <code>cat</code>)</p>
<h4 id="solution-2-remember-the-line-buffer-flag-to-grep">solution 2: remember the &ldquo;line buffer&rdquo; flag to grep</h4>
<p>You could remember that grep has a flag to avoid buffering and pass it like this:</p>
<pre><code>tail -f /some/log/file | grep --line-buffered thing1 | grep thing2
</code></pre>
<h4 id="solution-3-use-awk">solution 3: use awk</h4>
<p>Some people said that if they&rsquo;re specifically dealing with a multiple greps
situation, they&rsquo;ll rewrite it to use a single <code>awk</code> instead, like this:</p>
<pre><code>tail -f /some/log/file |  awk '/thing1/ &amp;&amp; /thing2/'
</code></pre>
<p>Or you would write a more complicated <code>grep</code>, like this:</p>
<pre><code>tail -f /some/log/file |  grep -E 'thing1.*thing2'
</code></pre>
<p>(<code>awk</code> also buffers, so for this to work you&rsquo;ll want <code>awk</code> to be the last command in the pipeline)</p>
<h4 id="solution-4-use-stdbuf">solution 4: use <code>stdbuf</code></h4>
<p><code>stdbuf</code> uses LD_PRELOAD to turn off libc&rsquo;s buffering, and you can use it to turn off output buffering like this:</p>
<pre><code>tail -f /some/log/file | stdbuf -o0 grep thing1 | grep thing2
</code></pre>
<p>Like any <code>LD_PRELOAD</code> solution it&rsquo;s a bit unreliable &ndash; it doesn&rsquo;t work on
static binaries, I think won&rsquo;t work if the program isn&rsquo;t using libc&rsquo;s
buffering, and doesn&rsquo;t always work on Mac OS. Harry Marr has a really nice <a href="https://hmarr.com/blog/how-stdbuf-works/">How stdbuf works</a> post.</p>
<h4 id="solution-5-use-unbuffer">solution 5: use <code>unbuffer</code></h4>
<p><code>unbuffer program</code> will force the program&rsquo;s output to be a TTY, which means
that it&rsquo;ll behave the way it normally would on a TTY (less buffering, colour
output, etc). You could use it in this example like this:</p>
<pre><code>tail -f /some/log/file | unbuffer grep thing1 | grep thing2
</code></pre>
<p>Unlike <code>stdbuf</code> it will always work, though it might have unwanted side
effects, for example <code>grep thing1</code>&rsquo;s will also colour matches.</p>
<p>If you want to install unbuffer, it&rsquo;s in the <code>expect</code> package.</p>
<h3 id="that-s-all-the-solutions-i-know-about">that&rsquo;s all the solutions I know about!</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bit hard for me to say which one is &ldquo;best&rdquo;, I think personally I&rsquo;m
mostly likely to use <code>unbuffer</code> because I know it&rsquo;s always going to work.</p>
<p>If I learn about more solutions I&rsquo;ll try to add them to this post.</p>
<h3 id="i-m-not-really-sure-how-often-this-comes-up">I&rsquo;m not really sure how often this comes up</h3>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s not very common for me to have a program that slowly trickles data
into a pipe like this, normally if I&rsquo;m using a pipe a bunch of data gets
written very quickly, processed by everything in the pipeline, and then
everything exits. The only examples I can come up with right now are:</p>
<ul>
<li>tcpdump</li>
<li><code>tail -f</code></li>
<li>watching log files in a different way like with <code>kubectl logs</code></li>
<li>the output of a slow computation</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-if-there-were-an-environment-variable-to-disable-buffering">what if there were an environment variable to disable buffering?</h3>
<p>I think it would be cool if there were a standard environment variable to turn
off buffering, like <code>PYTHONUNBUFFERED</code> in Python. I got this idea from a
<a href="https://blog.plover.com/Unix/stdio-buffering.html">couple</a> of <a href="https://blog.plover.com/Unix/stdio-buffering-2.html">blog posts</a> by Mark Dominus
in 2018. Maybe <code>NO_BUFFER</code> like <a href="https://no-color.org/">NO_COLOR</a>?</p>
<p>The design seems tricky to get right; Mark points out that NETBSD has <a href="https://man.netbsd.org/setbuf.3">environment variables called <code>STDBUF</code>, <code>STDBUF1</code>, etc</a> which gives you a
ton of control over buffering but I imagine most developers don&rsquo;t want to
implement many different environment variables to handle a relatively minor
edge case.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also curious about whether there are any programs that just automatically
flush their output buffers after some period of time (like 1 second). It feels
like it would be nice in theory but I can&rsquo;t think of any program that does that
so I imagine there are some downsides.</p>
<h3 id="stuff-i-left-out">stuff I left out</h3>
<p>Some things I didn&rsquo;t talk about in this post since these posts have been
getting pretty long recently and seriously does anyone REALLY want to read 3000
words about buffering?</p>
<ul>
<li>the difference between line buffering and having totally unbuffered output</li>
<li>how buffering to stderr is different from buffering to stdout</li>
<li>this post is only about buffering that happens <strong>inside the program</strong>, your
operating system&rsquo;s TTY driver also does a little bit of buffering sometimes</li>
<li>other reasons you might need to flush your output other than &ldquo;you&rsquo;re writing
to a pipe&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

### [2025 Recap: so many projects](https://fasterthanli.me/articles/2025-recap)

**摘要**: <p>I’ve been working on so many projects in 2025, I thought it was important for me

### [Introducing arborium, a tree-sitter distribution](https://fasterthanli.me/articles/introducing-arborium)

**来源**: Amos (fasterthanlime)

**摘要**: <p>About two weeks ago I entered a discussion with the docs.rs team about,
basically, why we have to look at this:</p>

In an effort to understand those reasons, I opened a GitHub issue which resulted
in a <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/docs.rs/issues/3040">short but productive</a> discussion.</p>

<p>I walked away discouraged, and then decided to, reasons be damned, attack this
problem from three different angles.</p>

### [color npm package compromised](https://fasterthanli.me/articles/color-npm-package-compromised)

**来源**: Amos (fasterthanlime)

**摘要**: <p>On September 8 2025, around 13:00 UTC, someone compromised <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/~qix">Josh Junon’s npm
account (qix)</a> and started publishing backdoored
versions of his package.</p>

<p>Someone noticed and let Josh know:</p>

<figure class="paragraph-like"><source media="(max-width: 400px)" type="image/jxl" /><source media="(max-width: 900px)" type="image/jxl" /><source type="image/jxl" /><source media="(max-width: 400px)" type="image/avif" /><source media="(max-width: 900px)" type="image/avif" /><source type="image/avif" /><source media="(max-width: 400px)" type="image/webp" /><source media="(max-width: 900px)" type="image/webp" /><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="Hey. Your npm account seems to have been compromised. 1 hour ago it started posting packages with backdoors to all your popular packages.

</a></cite></figcaption>
</figure><p>Josh confirmed he’d gotten pwned by a fake 2FA (two-factor authentication) reset e-mail:</p>

Only NPM affected. I've sent an email off to @npmjs.bsky.social  to see if I can get access again.  Sorry everyone, I should have paid more attention. Not like me; have had a stressful week. Will work to get this cleaned up.

### [All color is best-effort](https://fasterthanli.me/articles/all-color-is-best-effort)

**来源**: Amos (fasterthanlime)

**摘要**: <p>I do not come to you with answers today, but rather some observations and a lot of questions.</p>

<a class="anchor" href="https://fasterthanli.me/index.xml#the-weird-glitch" id="the-weird-glitch"><h2>The weird glitch</h2></a>
<p>Recently I was editing some video and I noticed this:</p>

<p>



<source media="(max-width: 400px)" type="image/jxl" /><source media="(max-width: 900px)" type="image/jxl" /><source type="image/jxl" /><source media="(max-width: 400px)" type="image/avif" /><source media="(max-width: 900px)" type="image/avif" /><source type="image/avif" /><source media="(max-width: 400px)" type="image/webp" /><source media="(max-width: 900px)" type="image/webp" /><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="A screenshot of the video, there are visible circles at various places in the image. Some of them are black, some of them are white. The image itself shows some blue and white text composited on some blurry background, which doesn’t really matter for this, and there’s a red line horizontal up in the image. It’s very confusing." height="1126" src="https://cdn.fasterthanli.me/content/articles/all-color-is-best-effort/dvr-circles@2x~3c031f1f42693336.jxl" title="A screenshot of the video, there are visible circles at various places in the image.

It’s very confusing." width="1966" /></p>

<p>Not what the finger is pointing at — the dots.</p>

<p>Here are the separate layers this image is made up of: the background is a stock image
I’ve licensed from Envato Elements:</p>

<p><source media="(max-width: 400px)" type="image/jxl" /><source media="(max-width: 900px)" type="image/jxl" /><source type="image/jxl" /><source media="(max-width: 400px)" type="image/avif" /><source media="(max-width: 900px)" type="image/avif" /><source type="image/avif" /><source media="(max-width: 400px)" type="image/webp" /><source media="(max-width: 900px)" type="image/webp" /><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="A picture of a canyon, darker than you’d expect." height="1126" src="https://cdn.fasterthanli.me/content/articles/all-color-is-best-effort/canyon-background@2x~dcfb5771209ddbd5.jxl" title="A picture of a canyon, darker than you’d expect." width="1966" /></p>

<p>Because I use it as a background image, I’ve cranked down the exposition in the Color tab:</p>

<li>Have you worked on metrics of measuring superior language or DSL fit to find the ultimate notation and thus tool of thought?</li>
<li>Are you tired of people badmouthing PHP while you're too tired to defend its honor, because you're actually shipping stuff?</li>
<li>Hell, do you have a good argument why Neolatino's <a href="https://terracalida.eu/per-que-falliscen-las-lenguas-artificiales" rel="ugc">better</a> than Esperanto?</li>
