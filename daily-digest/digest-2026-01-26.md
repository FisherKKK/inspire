### [The Possessed Machines (summary)](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ppBHrfY4bA6J7pkpS/the-possessed-machines-summary)

**来源**: LessWrong - AI

**摘要**: Published on January 25, 2026 8:47 PM GMT<br /><br /><p><a href="https://possessedmachines.com/">The Possessed Machines</a> is one of the most important AI microsites. It was published anonymously by an ex- lab employee, and does not seem to have spread very far, likely at least partly due to this anonymity (e.g. there is no LessWrong discussion at the time I'm posting this). This post is my attempt to fix that.</p><p>I do not agree with everything in the piece, but I think cultural critiques of the "AGI uniparty" are vastly undersupplied and incredibly important in modeling &amp; fixing the current trajectory.</p><p>The piece is a long but worthwhile analysis of some of the cultural and psychological failures of the AGI industry. The frame is Dostoevsky's <i>Demons</i> (alternatively translated <i>The Possessed</i>), a novel about ruin in a small provincial town. The author argues it's best read as a detailed description of earnest people causing a catastrophe by following tracks laid down by the surrounding culture that have gotten corrupted:</p><blockquote><p>What I know is that Dostoevsky, looking at his own time, saw something true about how intelligent societies destroy themselves. He saw that the destruction comes from the best as well as the worst, from the idealists as well as the cynics, from the people who believe they are saving humanity as well as those who want to burn it down.</p></blockquote><p>The piece is rich in good shorthands for important concepts, many taken from Dostoevsky, which I try to summarize below.</p><p><strong>First: how to generalize from fictional evidence, correctly</strong></p><p>The author argues for literature as a source of limited but valuable insight into questions of culture and moral intuition:</p><blockquote><p>Literature cannot tell us what to do. It cannot provide policy prescriptions or technical solutions. It cannot predict the future or settle empirical questions. The person who reads Dostoevsky looking for an alignment technique will be disappointed.</p><p>What literature can do is reshape perception. It can make visible patterns that were invisible, make felt truths that were merely known, make urgent realities that were abstract. It can serve as a kind of training data for moral intuition—presenting scenarios that expand the range of situations one has "experienced" and therefore the range of situations one can respond to wisely.</p><p>[...]</p><p>Dostoevsky's particular value is that he was obsessed with exactly the questions that matter most for AI development. What happens when intelligence develops faster than wisdom? What happens when the capacity for reasoning outstrips the capacity for feeling? What happens when small groups of smart people convince themselves they have discovered truths so important that normal constraints no longer apply?</p></blockquote><p><strong>Stavroginism: the human orthogonality thesis&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Stavrogin is a character for who moral considerations have become a parlor game. He can analyze everything and follow the threads of moral logic, but is not moved or compelled by them at a level beyond curiosity.</p><blockquote><p>The Stavrogin type can contemplate human extinction as calmly as they contemplate next quarter's revenue projections. This is not because they have thought more deeply about the question; it is because they lack the normal human response to existential horror. Their equanimity is not wisdom; it is damage.</p><p>[...]</p><p>They have looked at the abyss so long that they no longer see it. Their equanimity is not strength; it is the absence of appropriate emotional response.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Kirillovan reasoning: reasoning to suicide</strong></p><p>Closely related is Kirillov. Whereas Stavrogin is the detached curious observer to long chains of off-the-rails moral reasoning, Kirillov is the true believer.</p><blockquote><p>Yudkowsky has a useful concept he calls "the bottom line"—the idea that in any motivated reasoning process, the conclusion is written first, and the arguments are found afterward. [...]</p><p>But there is an opposite failure mode that Yudkowsky's framework does not adequately address: the person who follows arguments wherever they lead without any check on whether the conclusions make sense. This person is not engaging in motivated reasoning; they are engaging in unmotivated reasoning, deduction without sanity checks. Kirillov is the prototype.</p><p>[...]</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Kirillov [...] has arrived at the conclusion that suicide is the ultimate act of human freedom, the assertion of human will against the universe that created it. He plans to kill himself as a kind of metaphysical demonstration, and he has agreed to leave a suicide note taking responsibility for crimes committed by Pyotr Stepanovich's revolutionary cell.</p></blockquote><p>The author compares Kirillov to people who accept Pascal's wager -type EV calculations about positive singularities. A better example might be the successionists, some of who want humanity to collectively commit suicide as the ultimate act of human moral concern towards future AIs.</p><p><strong>Shigalyovism: reasoning to despotism</strong></p><blockquote><p>Shigalyov rises to present his system for organizing society. "I have become entangled in my own data," he begins, "and my conclusion directly contradicts the original idea from which I started. Starting from unlimited freedom, I end with unlimited despotism. I will add, however, that apart from my solution of the social formula, there is no other."</p><p>[...]</p><p>One character asks whether this is not simply a fantasy. Shigalyov replies that it is the inevitable conclusion of any serious attempt to organize society rationally. All other solutions are impossible because they require human nature to be other than it is. Only by eliminating freedom for the many can freedom be preserved for the few, and only the few are capable of handling freedom without destroying themselves and others.</p><p>[...]</p><p>The company reacts with fascination, horror, and a certain amount of admiration. No one can quite refute the argument. And this is Dostoevsky's point: the argument cannot be refuted on its own terms because its premises, once accepted, do indeed lead to its conclusions. The error is in the premises, but the premises are hidden behind such a mass of reasoning that they are difficult to locate.</p></blockquote><p>If Stavrogin is the intellectually entranced x-risk spectator &amp; speculator, and Kirillov is the self-destructive whacko, Shigalyov is the political theorist who has rederived absolute despotism and Platonic totalitarianism for the AGI era.</p><blockquote><p>The AI safety community has developed its own versions of Shigalyovism [...] The concept of a "pivotal act" is perhaps the clearest example. [...] The canonical example is using an aligned AI to prevent all other AI development—establishing a kind of permanent monopoly on artificial intelligence.</p><p>This is Shigalyovism in digital form. It begins with the desire to protect humanity and ends with a proposal for a single point of failure controlling all future technological development. The reasoning is internally consistent: if unaligned AI would destroy humanity, and if many independent AI projects increase the probability of unaligned AI, then preventing independent AI development reduces existential risk. QED.</p><p>But the conclusion is monstrous. A world in which a single entity controls all AI development is a world without meaningful freedom, without the possibility of exit, without any check on the power of whoever controls that entity. It is Shigalyov's one-tenth ruling over his nine-tenths, with the moral framework of "preventing extinction" replacing the moral framework of "achieving paradise."</p></blockquote><p><strong>Hollowed institutions</strong></p><blockquote><p>Dostoevsky's point is not that the revolutionaries are powerful but that the institutions they attack are weak. The provincial society of <i>Demons</i> has no genuine principles, no deep roots, no capacity for self-defense. It exists through inertia and convention. When those conventions are challenged, it collapses almost immediately.</p><p>[...]</p><p>I have watched equivalent dynamics in AI governance. I have sat in meetings where everyone present knew that a proposed deployment was risky, where no one was willing to be the person who stopped it. The social costs of objection were immediate and certain; the costs of acquiescence were diffuse and probabilistic. Every time, acquiescence won.</p><p>Dostoevsky understood that civilizations do not collapse because they are attacked by overwhelming external force. They collapse because their internal coherence decays to the point where even modest pressure can break them. The revolutionaries in <i>Demons</i> are not impressive people; they are provincial mediocrities. They succeed because the society they attack is even more mediocre.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Possession</strong></p><blockquote><p>The possession Dostoevsky describes is not primarily a matter of ideas entering minds from outside. It is a matter of capacities being developed without the corresponding wisdom to use them, of intelligence outrunning conscience, of means being cultivated without attention to ends.</p><p>The characters in <i>Demons</i> are not possessed by socialism or liberalism or nihilism as external forces. They are possessed by their own cleverness—by the intoxicating experience of reasoning without limit, of following thoughts wherever they lead, of treating everything as a puzzle to be solved rather than a reality to be encountered.</p></blockquote><p><strong>The AGI uniparty</strong></p><blockquote><p>The AI research community is not a collection of separate tribes; it is a single social organism that happens to be distributed across multiple corporate hosts.</p><p>Consider the actual topology. Researcher A at OpenAI dated Researcher B at Anthropic; they met at a house party in the Mission thrown by Researcher C, who left DeepMind last year and now runs a small alignment nonprofit. Researcher D at Google and Researcher E at Meta were roommates in graduate school and still share a group house with three other ML researchers who work at various startups. The safety lead at one major lab and the policy director at another were in the same MIRI summer program in 2017. The CEO of one frontier lab and the chief scientist of another served on the same nonprofit board.</p><p>This is not corruption in any conventional sense. It is simply how small, specialized communities work.</p><p>[...]</p><p>The official story is that the AI labs are competitors. [...] But the social topology undermines this story. When researchers move fluidly between organizations, they carry knowledge, assumptions, and culture with them.</p><p>[...]</p><p>The result is a kind of uniparty—a shared culture that supercedes corporate affiliation. The uniparty has its own beliefs (that AGI is coming relatively soon, that the current paradigm will scale, that technical alignment work is tractable), its own values (intellectual rigor, effective altruism, cosmopolitan liberalism), its own taboos (excessive pessimism, appeals to regulation, anything that smacks of Luddism). These shared beliefs, values, and taboos operate across organizational boundaries, creating a remarkable homogeneity of outlook among people who are nominally competitors.</p><p>[...]</p><p>The AI uniparty's shared premises include: that intelligence is the key variable in the future of civilization; that artificial intelligence will soon exceed human intelligence; that the people currently working on AI are therefore the most important people in history; that their technical and intellectual capabilities qualify them to make decisions for humanity. These premises are rarely stated explicitly, but they structure everything. They explain why the community can tolerate such high levels of risk—because the alternative (letting "less capable" people control the development) seems even worse.</p><p>[...]</p><p>One cannot believe that AI development should stop entirely. One cannot believe that the risks are so severe that no level of benefit justifies them. One cannot believe that the people currently working on AI are not the right people to be making these decisions. One cannot believe that traditional political processes might be better equipped to govern AI development than the informal governance of the research community.</p><p>These positions are not explicitly forbidden. They are simply unthinkable—they would mark one as an outsider, as someone who does not understand, as someone who is not part of the conversation. The boundary is maintained not through coercion but through the subtler mechanisms of social belonging: the raised eyebrow, the awkward silence, the failure to be invited to the next dinner party.</p></blockquote><p><strong>The liberal father as creator of the nihilist son</strong></p><p>Liberal Stepan's son Pyotr Stepanovich is a chief nihilist character in <i>Demons</i>. The author of The Possessed Machines argues this sort of thing - EA altruism turning into either outright nihilism or power-hunger - is a core cultural mechanic. I think they are directionally right but I don't follow their main example of this, which argues "technology ethics frameworks that are supposed to govern AI—fairness, accountability, transparency, the whole FAccT constellation—are the Stepan Trofimovich liberalism of our moment", and "the serious people [...] have moved past these frameworks" because they are obsolete. My read of the intellectual history is that AGI-related concerns and galaxy-brained arguments about the future of galaxies <i>preceded </i>that cluste rof more prosaic AI concerns, and they're different branches on the intellectual tree, rather than successors of each other.</p><p><strong>Handcuffed Shatov</strong></p><blockquote><p>Ivan Shatov is a former atheist who has returned to a mystical Russian Orthodoxy, a believer who cannot quite manage belief. He was once a member of Pyotr's revolutionary circle and now repudiates it, but the circle will not let him go. He is murdered by his former comrades for the crime of wanting to leave.</p><p>Shatov represents something important: the person who has come to doubt the project but cannot escape it. Every major AI lab has its Shatovs—researchers who have grown increasingly uncomfortable with the direction of their work but feel trapped by career incentives, social ties, stock options, and the genuine difficulty of imagining alternative paths. Some of them have left. Many more have stayed, hoping to "push from the inside," rationalizing their continued participation.</p><p>Dostoevsky shows us what happens to the Shatovs. They do not reform the movement from within. They are destroyed by it.</p></blockquote><p><strong>The solution is fundamentally spiritual</strong></p><blockquote><p>The ideological debate between liberals and radicals cannot be resolved through more ideology. The social dynamics of provincial conspiracy cannot be fixed through better coordination mechanisms. The psychological deformations of the intelligentsia cannot be healed through more intelligence. Something else is needed—something that operates at a different level, that addresses the human situation rather than any particular doctrine.</p><p>I am not a religious person, and I am not advocating for religious solutions to AI risk. But I think Dostoevsky is pointing toward something important: the limits of political and technical approaches to problems that are fundamentally spiritual in nature.</p><p>The word "spiritual" is likely to provoke allergic reactions in a rationalist context. Let me try to be precise about what I mean by it. The core problem with AI development is not that we lack good alignment techniques (though we do). It is not that the incentive structures are wrong (though they are). It is not that the governance mechanisms are inadequate (though they are). The core problem is that the people making the key decisions are, many of them, damaged in ways that disqualify them from making these decisions wisely.</p><p>This damage is not primarily intellectual. The people I am thinking of are intelligent, often extraordinarily so. It is something more like moral—a failure of the channels that connect knowledge to action, that make abstract truths feel binding, that generate appropriate emotional responses to contemplated harms.</p></blockquote><br /><br /><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ppBHrfY4bA6J7pkpS/the-possessed-machines-summary#comments">Discuss</a>

### [Notable Progress Has Been Made in Whole Brain Emulation](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/DGsBfcEQKuNPmQizQ/notable-progress-has-been-made-in-whole-brain-emulation)

**来源**: LessWrong - AI

**摘要**: Published on January 25, 2026 7:07 PM GMT<br /><br /><h2>Summary</h2><p>We have [relatively] recently scanned the whole fruit fly brain, simulated it, confirmed it is pretty highly constrained by morphology alone. Other groups have been working on optical techniques and genetic work to make the scanning process faster and simulations more accurate.</p><h2>Fruit Flies When You’re Having Fun</h2><p>The <a href="https://seunglab.org/">Seung Lab</a> famously mapped the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07558-y">fruit fly connectome</a> using serial section electron microscopy. What is underappreciated is that another group used this information to create a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07763-9">whole brain emulation of the fruit fly</a>. Now, it used leaky integrate and fire neurons and did not model the body of the fly, but it is still a huge technical achievement. The first author has gone off to work at <a href="https://eon.systems/">Eon Systems</a>, which is very explicitly aimed at human whole brain emulation.</p><p>They did some cool things in the simulation. One is that they shuffled the synaptic weights to see how much that changed the neural activity. Turns out, quite a bit. This is a good thing because it means they’re probably right about how synaptic weight manifests in morphology.</p><blockquote><p>Although modelling using the correct connectome results in robust activation of MN9 in 100% of simulations when sugar-sensing neurons are activated at 100 Hz, only 1 of 100 shuffled simulations did (Supplementary Table 1d). Therefore, the predictive accuracy of our computational model depends on the actual connectivity weights of the fly connectome.</p></blockquote><p>I would recommend reading the whole paper. I think I would do it a disservice by giving an intermediate level of detail in a summary. They just got mind-blowingly good results for such a simple model and it really gives me hope that the actual simulation aspect is a much more tractable problem than I once thought<span class="footnote-reference" id="fnref05g43nc5vo8w"><sup><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/feed.xml?view=community-rss&amp;karmaThreshold=30#fn05g43nc5vo8w">[1]</a></sup></span>.</p><h2>Connectome Tracing Now And The Near Future</h2><p>The two biggest issues with connectome tracing right now are speed and accuracy. It takes a long time to image all the samples and is very costly to parallelize the process because electron microscopes are expensive. As for accuracy, it seems like it would be unreasonable to ask for more resolution than an electron microscope offers. This is true but because everything is grayscale segmentation becomes hugely challenging. One of the biggest bottlenecks in the pipeline is human proofreading of the data. We have a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-018-0049-4">good algorithm</a> for this, but it does require a substantial human effort after the first pass. The whole fruit fly brain took ~33 years of human proofreading to complete. Accuracy stays around 90% in the most optimistic case without human involvement. A naïve extrapolation from the fly → mouse brain time would be ~10,000 years of proofreading which is suboptimal. Additionally, many of the proofreaders were trained in neuroanatomy which would further increase the difficulty of using human workers for this process. So yeah, I really want people to work on this problem it seems very important to me.</p><p>I am of the opinion that electron microscopy is not the way forward because of these factors and others that will be discussed later. Still, it is the only proven technology and there may be a place to do a hybrid approach with optical providing some information using traditional stains and electron microscopes providing the highest possible resolution.</p><p>There are also issues of sample preparation and the exact kind of electron microscope you use. Samples must be sectioned very thin in the axial direction as scanning microscopes can’t see subsurface detail and transmission microscopes have limited penetration depth. If the samples are cut mechanically they generally have artifacts from that which make segmentation across the boundary more challenging. Samples can be destroyed with ion milling or treated such that they photodegrade, this leaves a much cleaner surface for the next imaged section but destroying the samples makes multiple imaging steps challenging.</p><p>For much, much more detail I recommend reading <a href="https://wellcome.org/insights/reports/scaling-connectomics">this</a> projection for what would it would take to image a whole mouse brain.</p><h2>Multimodal Data Analysis</h2><p>There are two big obvious limitations with the fruit fly simulation. The first is that it does not even attempt to model the rest of the fly’s body. I’m comfortable with this, people have been trying to simulate <i>C. elegans </i>for decades now and they still don’t have a complete biophysical model. This is a big challenge, but not my chief interest. The second limitation is in their cell model itself. They used a leaky integrate and fire model that was identical for each neuron. I understand why they did this and I don’t think they actually could have done much better with the data they had, but they also openly admit this is a limitation. Well, there is some recent progress that addresses this gap.</p><p><br />Neurons are inhomogeneous in many ways. One is electrical activity, two neurons will spike differently when given the same current stimulus. Another is gene expression. There are a lot of <a href="https://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/IonChannelListForward?class=VGIC">genes</a> that are known to govern <a href="https://channelpedia.epfl.ch/">ion channels</a> which determine the electrical activity in the neuron. It is a very natural to ask whether or not you can predict the electrophysiology properties of the neurons based on the gene expression. Well, <a href="https://www.cell.com/patterns/fulltext/S2666-3899(25)00171-0">one recent paper</a> sets out to answer just that. I would say that the big conclusion relevant to this is</p><blockquote><p>… that the variation in gene expression levels can be used to predict electrophysiology accurately on a family level but less so on the cell-type level.</p></blockquote><p>Despite this, I am still confident about this technique being viable for generating models of individual neurons. Why is that? Because the technique they used to measure gene expression is <a href="https://academic.oup.com/gpb/article/23/4/qzaf077/8241969">known to be inaccurate</a>. Other methods of measuring gene expression, I am a proponent of MERFISH<span class="footnote-reference" id="fnref7ocyzmjot4r"><sup><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/feed.xml?view=community-rss&amp;karmaThreshold=30#fn7ocyzmjot4r">[2]</a></sup></span>, are <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9760489/">comparable or perhaps even better</a>. In the event that these techniques remain inaccurate or are insufficient by themselves, it seems likely that traditional <a href="https://www.alomone.com/getting-ion-channel-immunostaining-right">antibody staining</a> could allow for direct measurement of ion channel density<span class="footnote-reference" id="fnref6i9ltishs59"><sup><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/feed.xml?view=community-rss&amp;karmaThreshold=30#fn6i9ltishs59">[3]</a></sup></span>.</p><p>I also want to make it very clear that I have an extreme admiration for the work that they did. I <a href="https://www.dompols.com/im-was-working-on-met-stuff/">personally tried</a> using some of the same data to achieve the gene expression to biophysical model transformation and can attest to the fact that it is quite challenging. Their paper has a lot of stuff in it I wish I tried, and is quite readable in my opinion. Specifically, I applaud them for trying to fit a relatively simple model. One of my biggest frustrations when I read neuroscience papers are people trying to answer questions they clearly didn’t lay the groundwork for.&nbsp;<br /><br />Now, even once that is achieved we will still be missing some important factors like how hormones or peptides influence the activity of a neuron. But this is a step in the right direction. Knowing the connectome with weights gets you a long way, making specific cell models gets you closer, knowing the effects of hormones, peptides, blood flow, whatever glial cells are doing, etc. matters but might have a collectively smaller effect than the first two factors. I am not sure how confident I am in that statement, biology is an bottomless well of complexity and some of those higher order effects could be much more important than I appreciate. But all this is really just dancing around my main opinion, which I endorse quite strongly, that we need to have a model more specific than a single template leaky integrate and fire neuron for most of the neurons in the brain and we can likely achieve this with current generation imaging techniques.</p><h2>E11 Bio</h2><p><a href="https://www.e11.bio/">E11 Bio</a> is a focused research organization that is, well, focused on researching connectome mapping. They have a cool technique combining <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.09.26.678648v1">expansion microscopy and genetic barcoding</a> to make tracing neurons much much easier.</p><p>I discussed the limitations of electron microscopy above. Well, expansion microscopy is a cool way to get around this. The sample can be permeated by a hydrogel that swells causing the whole thing to expand roughly homogenously. This can be up to 10x in a single step iirc but that cool thing is that you can do it multiple times if you really want. E11 Bio is doing 5x which I trust is sufficient for their need. The genetic barcoding is a way to have functionally infinite color channels such that you can uniquely identify each neuron. I’m not natively a genetics guy so I might summarize this wrong, but my understanding is that each neuron is infected by a random subset of viruses that are injected into the brain. Each virus codes for a specific protein that can be bound to antibody stains. By sequentially staining and then washing away antibodies bound to fluorescent probes you can image the sample once for each possible virus. Each neuron will either be infected or not for each given virus and so it will either fluoresce or not for each given stain/image/wash cycle. This gives each one a unique bit string to identify it even across long projections. All in all, very cool and computationally more simple than trying to segment cell images taken in grayscale. It only marginally improves (~5x fewer errors) the automatic segmentation accuracy and would still rely heavily on human proofreading<span class="footnote-reference" id="fnrefpm9zo6qx8l"><sup><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/feed.xml?view=community-rss&amp;karmaThreshold=30#fnpm9zo6qx8l">[4]</a></sup></span>. But still, very obvious step in the right direction and I am glad to hear it is being worked on.</p><p>You do start to get issues with distortion if you expand too much but then it becomes an engineering trade off. Would you rather the computer have to correct for these distortions, or deal with the numerous physical and computational challenges EM data introduces? I’ll admit I’m biased here but the technology is really cool and opens up a huge range of microscopy techniques giving potential OOMs improvements for imaging and post processing speed. If you are interested in connectome tracing feasibility, I would recommend <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-methods/fulltext/S2667-2375(25)00024-4">this paper</a> comparing expansion microscopy to electron microscopy. Their most optimistic timeline for mice is ~5 days but ~30 years for a human brain. 30 years is a long time to wait around, improvements will be made in speed and cost allowing more work to be done in parallel but it is unclear if imaging a whole human brain in sufficient resolution will be feasible any time soon.</p><h2>What I Would Work On</h2><p>Based on the above, there are several key problems that I think need to be addressed if we want to do whole brain emulation. This is by no means an exhaustive list, these are things I can point to as clearly identified gaps.</p><ol><li>High throughput imaging with sufficient detail, ideally less than 10nm in all directions<span class="footnote-reference" id="fnrefk1yh9c1feg"><sup><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/feed.xml?view=community-rss&amp;karmaThreshold=30#fnk1yh9c1feg">[5]</a></sup></span><ol><li>Improve mechanical or destructive sectioning to gather all necessary information while minimizing artifacts at the boundaries</li><li>Speed is the biggest consideration, this can be achieved by bringing cost down so more microscopes can operate in parallel or by making each on faster without increasing cost proportionally</li></ol></li><li>More sub cellular detail<ol><li>Find the density of ion channels for a particular neuron</li><li>Identify gap junctions between neurons</li><li>Identify the neurotransmitters used by each neuron more accurately<span class="footnote-reference" id="fnref6mszh5wcd7u"><sup><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/feed.xml?view=community-rss&amp;karmaThreshold=30#fn6mszh5wcd7u">[6]</a></sup></span></li><li>A way to extract information relevant to neuromodulation, this is not possible or extremely hard with EM data</li></ol></li><li>Improve automated segmentation, eliminating the need for any human proofreading is ideal</li><li>More advanced modeling of cells with verification that the subcellular details listed above recreate the electrical and chemical activities accurately</li><li>This is a lot of data, you need a lot of storage and fast transfers to avoid that bottlenecking the microscopes<span class="footnote-reference" id="fnref40dl2cegsk7"><sup><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/feed.xml?view=community-rss&amp;karmaThreshold=30#fn40dl2cegsk7">[7]</a></sup></span></li></ol><ol class="footnote-section footnotes"><li class="footnote-item" id="fn05g43nc5vo8w"><span class="footnote-back-link"><sup><strong><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/feed.xml?view=community-rss&amp;karmaThreshold=30#fnref05g43nc5vo8w">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class="footnote-content"><p>I am still really worried about biological learning rules, I don’t think anyone understands those well enough that we could make a WBE of a mouse and have it memorize a maze or something.

Bottom line is this: if you know how to do computer vision you should work on this problem, it is important and cool!</p></div></li><li class="footnote-item" id="fnk1yh9c1feg"><span class="footnote-back-link"><sup><strong><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/feed.xml?view=community-rss&amp;karmaThreshold=30#fnrefk1yh9c1feg">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class="footnote-content"><p>As said previous, expansion microscopy lets you get away with a microscope that does not have that high resolution natively.

### [Canada Lost Its Measles Elimination Status Because We Don't Have Enough Nurses Who Speak Low German](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/H8RdAbAmsqbpBWoDd/canada-lost-its-measles-elimination-status-because-we-don-t)

**来源**: LessWrong - AI

**摘要**: Published on January 25, 2026 6:33 PM GMT<br /><br /><p><i>This post was originally published on November 11th, 2025. I've been spending some time reworking and cleaning up the Inkhaven posts I'm most proud of, and completed the process for this one today.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Today, Canada officially lost its measles elimination status. Measles was previously declared eliminated in Canada in 1998, but countries lose that status after <a href="https://www.therecord.com/news/canada/ontario-declares-measles-outbreak-over-after-nearly-a-year-of-spread/article_ab2a3ab7-e6f0-536c-b3f9-fd6ffe2b5c16.html">12 months of continuous transmission</a>.</p><p>Here are some articles about the the fact that we have lost our measles elimination status: <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/livestory/canada-measles-elimination-status-9.6973195">CBC</a>, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy7e2lv4r8xo">BBC</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/10/world/canada/canada-measles-what-to-know.html">New York Times</a>, <a href="https://torontolife.com/city/canada-has-lost-its-measles-elimination-status/">Toronto Life</a>. You can see some chatter on Reddit about it if you're interested <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/1otf41o/canada_loses_measles_elimination_status_cbc/">here</a>.</p><p>None of the above texts seemed to me to be focused on the actual thing that caused Canada to lose its measles elimination status, which is the rampant spread of measles among old-order religious communities, particularly the Mennonites. (Mennonites are basically, like, Amish-lite. Amish people can marry into Mennonite communities if they want a more laid-back lifestyle, but the reverse is not allowed. Similarly, old-order Mennonites can marry into less traditionally-minded Mennonite communities, but the reverse is not allowed.)</p><p>The Reddit comments that made this point are generally not highly upvoted<span class="footnote-reference" id="fnrefk4o4x6xjq3"><sup><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/feed.xml?view=community-rss&amp;karmaThreshold=30#fnk4o4x6xjq3">[1]</a></sup></span>, and this was certainly not a central point in any of the articles. It is a periphery point in all of the articles above at best. Toronto Life is particularly egregious, framing it like so:</p><blockquote><p><i>"mis- and disinformation were factors in the outcome, which are partly due to pockets around the country with low vaccination rates."</i></p></blockquote><p>This is, ironically, misinformation: true information framed in such a way to precisely give you the incorrect view of things.</p><p>In this post I will make two arguments: first, yes, it is the Mennonites that began (and are the biggest victims of) the biggest measles outbreak of the current century, and second, thinking of them as resistant to vaccination is actively harmful to the work of eliminating measles from Canada once again.</p><p>I've been following the measles outbreak closely for basically its entire duration, because I have a subscription to my local newspaper, the Waterloo Record. The writers there do frequent updates on the outbreak, often with higher quality and more detail than you get in the national papers. This is because Waterloo Region has a significant Mennonite population, so shit sometimes got real scuffed.</p><p>Like, over last spring, there were fairly regular advisories about local stores we shouldn't go into or quarantine if we did because someone with measles went in. One of them was the pharmacy across the street from the university campus, so that was fun.</p><p><img alt="Pasted image 20251110195337" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/H8RdAbAmsqbpBWoDd/evzitebnsx3apcr8fnm3" /> <img alt="Pasted image 20251110195411" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/H8RdAbAmsqbpBWoDd/e79o8mg4slpdxxtpab4e" /></p><h2>The Mennonite Outbreak</h2><p>Here is what the outbreak looks like, Canada-wide:&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img alt="measles-canada" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/H8RdAbAmsqbpBWoDd/jxfdwjilb6moewxgtwip" /><figcaption>&nbsp;<a href="https://health-infobase.canada.ca/measles-rubella/"><i>Health Canada</i></a></figcaption></figure><p>Full offense to Health Canada: this is a terrible graphic, because if you don't look at it carefully you will think that the provinces in dark blue have approximately the same number of cases, and this is very false. Sasksatchewan has barely over a hundred, Alberta has almost 2000, and Ontario has almost 2400 cases.</p><p>What's the deal with Ontario, and Alberta? Some of it comes down to the numbers game; those are two of our most populous provinces. But Quebec has twice the population of Alberta, and it's trucking on with only 36 cases in the entire province.</p><p>The answer is that it's the Mennonites, who are overwhelmingly settled in those two provinces.<span class="footnote-reference" id="fnref7oxd4w45kp8"><sup><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/feed.xml?view=community-rss&amp;karmaThreshold=30#fn7oxd4w45kp8">[2]</a></sup></span></p><p>I'll be focusing on the outbreak in Ontario, because that's the part of the story I'm more familiar with. If you dig into <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/london/measles-death-southwestern-ontario-1.7553265">older</a> <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/article/not-surprising-heres-what-drove-canadas-lost-measles-free-status-says-one-expert/">news</a> pieces, the Mennonite connection is corroborated by government officials:</p><blockquote><p>Previously, Moore [the Chief Medical Officer for Ontario] shared that this outbreak in Ontario was traced back to a Mennonite wedding in New Brunswick, and is spreading primarily in Mennonite and Amish communities where vaccination rates lag. The vast majority of those cases are in southwestern Ontario.</p></blockquote><p>Mennonites have a social structure where, once the community reaches a certain number of families, they undergo mitosis, and half the families split off to form a new community far away. Based on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/newbrunswickcanada/comments/1lzxl13/outbreak_of_measles_in_sussex_nb/n35u36s/">reddit</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/newbrunswickcanada/comments/1mf48gz/amish_people_around/n6h1h1y/">scuttlebutt</a>, it seems like there has recently been a daughter community that moved from southern Ontario to New Brunswick, which makes it doubly unsurprising that there were many southern Ontario attendees to the original superspreader event.</p><p>Additionally, Moore, remarked in a <a href="https://www.ottawapublichealth.ca/en/professionals-and-partners/resources/Documents/CMOH-Measles-Memorandum-to-PHU_2025-03-07_Signed.pdf">memo</a> he sent out to local health bodies:</p><blockquote><p>Over 90% of cases in Ontario linked to this outbreak are among unimmunized individuals. Cases could spread in any unvaccinated community or population but are disproportionately affecting some Mennonite, Amish, and other Anabaptist communities due to a combination of under-immunization and exposure to measles in certain areas.</p></blockquote><p>And <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/11214661/ont-measles-mennonite/">Global News</a> reports:</p><blockquote><p>In an April interview with The Canadian Press [Moore] reasserted that the “vast majority” of Ontario’s cases are among people in [Mennonite, Amish, and other Anabaptist] communities.</p></blockquote><p>Some smaller publications have found connections in their own investigation. The <a href="https://lfpress.com/news/local-news/mennonite-gathering-in-new-brunswick-source-of-ontario-measles-outbreak">London [Ontario] Free Press</a> in March 2025 (the beginning of the outbreak) linked the outbreak in West Texas to <i>their</i> Mennonite population, and identified that several measles exposure sites in counties that have been heavily afflicted by measles are Mennonite in nature:</p><blockquote><p>A list of measles exposure sites in Grand Erie includes a church and several private Christian schools in western Norfolk County catering to Old Colony Mennonites, and Moore’s letter confirmed the link.</p></blockquote><p>A recent <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/11/10/canada-measles-free-status/">Washington Post</a> article also corroborates the link, but buries it under several paragraphs of preamble about general vaccine skepticism.</p><blockquote><p>Many large measles outbreaks in Canada have occurred in insular Mennonite communities in rural Alberta and Ontario, where some are skeptical of vaccines.</p><p>Outbreaks have also been reported in Mennonite communities in Mexico and West Texas.</p></blockquote><h2>Mennonite Geography</h2><p><a href="https://www.publichealthontario.ca/-/media/Documents/M/24/measles-ontario-epi-summary.pdf">Public Health Ontario</a> has infection numbers for you, broken down by geographic area ("public health units"). Here's what that looks like when I plot them on a graph. Notice that there are five units that are responsible for basically all of the cases, and you will have heard of none of them because they include zero major population centres.</p><p><img alt="Pasted image 20260119211643" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/H8RdAbAmsqbpBWoDd/j9xvkse2vfnpelnkvyw1" /> The most populous health units, such as Toronto, Ottawa, Halton, Hamilton, Peel, and York, all have three cases or fewer for the entire year, and a corresponding case rate of close to zero.</p><p>I admit that I do not have the temerity required to separate out Mennonites from like, generic rural dwellers, but something wonky is going on here! The measles outbreaks are all in sparsely populated regions while the big cities (with their big suburbs, presumably where all the anti-vaxxers would be) carry on basically unscathed.</p><p>To better visualize this, I am going to combine a bunch of charts together jankily: the <a href="https://www.publichealthontario.ca/-/media/Documents/M/24/measles-ontario-epi-summary.pdf">geographic distribution of measles</a> (blue), population density (red, adapted from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Ontario#/media/File:Canada_Ontario_Density_2016.png">Wikipedia</a>, and, in lime green, the settlements of <a href="https://www.mhso.org/sites/default/files/publications/Ontmennohistory35-1_0.pdf">Amish</a> and <a href="https://canadianmennonite.org/old-order-mennonite-groups-ontario-are-growing/">Mennonite</a> <a href="https://canadaalive.wordpress.com/2014/03/31/old-order-mennonites/">communities</a> I found online.<span class="footnote-reference" id="fnref6z9fo4hxtrm"><sup><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/feed.xml?view=community-rss&amp;karmaThreshold=30#fn6z9fo4hxtrm">[3]</a></sup></span></p><figure class="image"><img alt="measles-map-final" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/H8RdAbAmsqbpBWoDd/pzizs4xzkf18mc0csi0l" /><figcaption>&nbsp;<i>I tried to match the map outlines in procreate by hand, which means it was done imperfectly.</i>&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>Okay, sorry, you will need to stare at it for a bit. The key takeaway is that the blue areas (which represents measles cases) almost perfectly avoids the most populated areas (red), and are full of green dots (where the Mennonite and Amish settlements are).</p><p>Let's look at this another way. Here's a Public Health Ontario <a href="https://files.ontario.ca/moh-covid-19-report-en-2022-04-29.pdf">COVID report from April 2022</a> (i.e. after vaccinations have been available for a while). Pages 8-10 include comparable charts on cases per 100,000 people broken down by Public Health Unit. It's relatively stable between PHUs, and larger in city centres compared to rural settlements. This makes sense, because urban settlements are by definition denser, which means it's easier for viruses to spread.</p><p><img alt="Pasted image 20260119221233" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/H8RdAbAmsqbpBWoDd/yoyd7relelm1y5qp0fbb" /></p><p>Here are the outbreaks plotted against each other, if you're curious.<span class="footnote-reference" id="fnrefquilwoog7k9"><sup><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/feed.xml?view=community-rss&amp;karmaThreshold=30#fnquilwoog7k9">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Notice that the same five public health units no one has heard of are outliers again, which is what you would expect.</p><p><img alt="Pasted image 20260119221425" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/H8RdAbAmsqbpBWoDd/ce0g6ontlucretvmuo9k" /></p><p>Also note the different degrees of variance in cases per 100,000 people in a health unit. COVID cases per 100k ranged from about 4,000 to 11,600 across health units, which is roughly a 3x difference. The Measles cases were actually incredibly discontinuous across units: many units had literally zero cases, some had under 30 cases per 100,000 people, then there's a huge gap, and then there's five regions that had over 100 cases per 100,000 people.</p><p>For the statistically inclined, the coefficient of variation (standard deviation divided by mean, expressed as a percentage) was about 25% for COVID and 193% for measles, which is almost eight times higher.<span class="footnote-reference" id="fnref394qq3cn7yo"><sup><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/feed.xml?view=community-rss&amp;karmaThreshold=30#fn394qq3cn7yo">[5]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;(If these numbers mean nothing to you, don't worry about it. The point is just that COVID spread relatively evenly and measles did not.)</p><p>Lastly, here is some incidental info from <a href="https://macleans.ca/society/behind-the-scenes-of-ontarios-mennonite-measles-outbreak/">some July 2025 coverage</a> on the outbreak in St. Thomas (a smaller city, in that vertical belt of green dots across central southern Ontario, in the PHU <a href="https://geohub.lio.gov.on.ca/datasets/ministry-of-health-public-health-unit-boundary/explore?location=44.048698%2C-80.539291%2C7.00">Southwestern Public Health</a> which is the one with the most cases):</p><blockquote><p>Five months later, around 150 to 200 of our [Mennonite] clients have had measles, and most of our Low German–speaking clients have at least had symptoms.</p></blockquote><p>As of October 28, there has been 771 cases of measles in the Southwestern PHU. If 150-200 of them were Low German-speaking mennonites as of July, <i>and most of their clients had symptoms at that time</i>, this indicates that the Mennonites would have made up for a substantial amount of all cases in that PHU.</p><p>I rest my case! Which is not to say that it is a perfect one but here is where I put it down because I am not going to put more effort into it. I encourage others to pick it up and put more work into it if they are so inclined.</p><h2>Mennonites Are Susceptible To Facts and Logic, When Presented In Low German</h2><p>The general sentiment both in the reddit comments and in most of the news coverage seems to be something like "oh, they're weird religious people, and therefore immune to logic about vaccines", and also something something religious tolerance meaning that we can't criticize their choices at all.<span class="footnote-reference" id="fnrefamdfndnkov9"><sup><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/feed.xml?view=community-rss&amp;karmaThreshold=30#fnamdfndnkov9">[6]</a></sup></span></p><p>But in reality, Mennonite parents love their children and do not want them to die of measles, and they do not want to contract measles themselves. Having looked into it, it seems to me like the largest barrier for them getting medical care and vaccination is that <i>they are not fluent in English, they speak Low German</i>.</p><p>In Ontario, <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/london/what-this-mennonite-healthcare-provider-learned-working-during-the-measles-outbreak-1.7599554?cmp=rss">three quarters</a>(!!!!!!) of the 700 Mennonite community clients helped by a Low German-speaking personal support worker have agreed to be vaccinated.</p><p>In Alberta (the other large Mennonite population centre, and not coincidentally the other large site of the outbreak), there has been a <a href="https://www.therecord.com/life/addressing-fear-in-albertas-mennonite-community-amid-a-measles-outbreak/article_ddad7231-fa80-522b-9851-f4357ec459ff.html">25% increase</a> in demand for medical care in Low-German, and service has expanded from five to seven days a week.</p><p>And, like, yes, to be clear, there are loads of Mennonites who are actually anti-vaccine. I am not disputing the obvious fact that, in religious communities, many people are against vaccinations. Further, 75% still falls very short of the <a href="https://www.aap.org/en/patient-care/measles/measles-vaccine/">92-94% vaccination rate needed for herd immunity</a>. But a 75% vaccination rate is much, <i>much</i> higher than I'd have hoped for?</p><p>Here is <a href="https://macleans.ca/society/behind-the-scenes-of-ontarios-mennonite-measles-outbreak/">an example</a> of the miscommunication that can happen when one is not fluent in English:</p><blockquote><p>The following morning, the [Mennonite] mother called me: her child [who recently developed a measles rash] was coughing so violently she was vomiting. I told her to go to the hospital. Later, she called me again, upset. She said that when she got to the ER, they’d told her to go home.&nbsp;</p><p>I couldn’t help but think something was off. The hospital doesn’t turn people away, I told her, but she insisted that they had. So I called them directly to figure out what had happened. It turned out there had been a miscommunication. Hospital staff had told her not to come in, using a “stop” hand gesture to communicate, and she had become so flustered that she failed to catch the second part of the message: that she should wait in the car while they prepared a negative-pressure room.</p></blockquote><p>If your measles outbreak comes from this sort of community, the solution isn't to fearmonger about anti-vaxxers. It is to train up and hire health care workers who can speak Low German. And to be clear, I think the PHUs that are affected are doing this, or at least the Ontario ones are, because our public health bodies are generally not disconnected from reality.</p><p>And that's what I found most frustrating about the media coverage. It obscures something that's genuinely very hopeful and turns it into another random culture war shitfest. But actually, it turns out that when you remove the actual language and access barriers, people make reasonable healthcare decisions for their families at pretty high rates!</p><p>So yes, Canada lost its measles elimination status today. But we can get it back in a year and a bit, if we're serious. And if we're serious about eliminating measles again, we need to focus more on investing in healthcare workers who speak the language of and can build relationships in communities, and less on implying that certain populations are fundamentally unreachable.</p><ol class="footnote-section footnotes"><li class="footnote-item" id="fnk4o4x6xjq3"><span class="footnote-back-link"><sup><strong><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/feed.xml?view=community-rss&amp;karmaThreshold=30#fnrefk4o4x6xjq3">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class="footnote-content"><p>This was more true in November, a few comments who made this claim have now been highly upvoted.</p></div></li><li class="footnote-item" id="fn7oxd4w45kp8"><span class="footnote-back-link"><sup><strong><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/feed.xml?view=community-rss&amp;karmaThreshold=30#fnref7oxd4w45kp8">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class="footnote-content"><p>There is a trend in the media to avoid naming specific demographics when they are disproportionately involved in bad things.

### [A tale of three theories: sparsity, frustration, and statistical field theory](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/siu22scEfuKxpSgfK/a-tale-of-three-theories-sparsity-frustration-and)

**来源**: LessWrong - AI

**摘要**: Published on January 25, 2026 6:09 PM GMT<br /><br /><p>This post is an informal preliminary writeup of a project that I've been working on with friends and collaborators. Some of the theory was developed jointly with Zohar Ringel, and we hope to write a more formal paper on it this year. Experiments are joint with Lucas Teixeira (and also an extensive use of llm assistants). This work is part of the research agenda we have been running with Lucas Teixeira and Lauren Greenspan at my organization <a href="https://princint.ai/">Principles of Intelligence</a> (formerly PIBBSS), and Lauren helped in writing this post.</p><h1>Introduction</h1><h2>Pre-introduction</h2><p>I have had trouble writing an introduction to this post. It combines three aspects of interpretability that I like and have thought about in the last two years:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Questions about <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05451">computation in superposition</a></li><li>The mean field approach to understanding neural nets. This is a way of describing neural nets as multi-particle statistical theories, and has been applied in contexts of both Bayesian and SGD learning that has had significant success in the last few years.

I am tempted to write a very general introduction which tries to introduce all three phenomena and explain how they are linked together via the experimental context I'll present here. However, this would be confusing and hard to read – people tend to like my technical writing much better when I take to heart the advice: "<a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/4ZvJab25tDebB8FGE/you-get-about-five-words">you get about five words</a>".&nbsp;</p><p>So for this post I will focus on one aspect of the work, which is related to the physical notion of <strong>frustration</strong> and the effect this interesting physical structure has on the rest of the system via a source of <strong>irreducible noise</strong>. Thus if I were to summarize a five-work takeaway I want to explain in this post, it is this:</p><blockquote><p>Loss landscapes have irreducible noise.</p></blockquote><p>In some ways this is obvious: real data is noisy and has lots of randomness. But the present work shows that noise is even more fundamental than randomness from data. Even in settings where the data distribution is highly symmetric and structured and the neural net is trained on infinite data, interference in the network itself (caused by a complex system responding to conflicting incentives) leads to unavoidable fluctuations in the loss landscape. In some sense this is good news for interpretability: physical systems with irreducible noise will often tend towards having more independence between structures at different scales and can be more amenable to causal decoupling and <i>renormalization</i>-based analyses. Moreover, if we can understand the structure and source of the noise, we can incorporate it into interpretability analyses.&nbsp;</p><p>In this case the small-scale noise in the landscape is induced by an emergent property of the system at a larger scale. Namely, early in training the weights of this system develop a coarse large-scale structure similar to the discrete up/down spins of a magnet. For reasons related to <i>interference </i>in data with superposition, the discrete structure is <i>frustrated</i> and therefore in some sense forced to be asymmetric and random. The frustrated structures on a large scale interact with small fluctuations of the system on a small scale, and lead to microscopic random ripples that follow a similar physics to the impurities in a semiconducting metal.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/siu22scEfuKxpSgfK/x7qtsqvxxmb4bkv3ekg2" /><figcaption>These two graphs represent the weights of two fully trained neural nets, trained on similar tasks and with the same number of parameters (each dot in the graph records two parameters). On the left we have a system without frustration or impurities, whereas on the right the learning problem develops frustration (due to superposition) and the weights at the loss minimum get perturbed by asymmetric and essentially random impurity corrections inherited from frustrated structure.</figcaption></figure><h2>The task</h2><p>In this work we analyze a task that originally comes from our paper on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05451">Computation in Superposition</a> (CiS).</p><p>Sparse data with superposition was originally studied in the field of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compressed_sensing">compressed sensing</a> and dictionary learning. Analyzing modern transformer networks using techniques from this field (especially <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08600">sparse autoencoders</a>) has led to a paradigm shift in interpretability over the last 3 years. Researchers have found that the hidden-layer activation data in transformers is mathematically well-described by sparse superpositional combinations of so-called "dictionary features" or SAE features; moreover these features have nice interpretability properties, and variants of SAE's have provided some of the best unsupervised interpretability techniques used in the last few years<span class="footnote-reference" id="fnref5pe16miuryo"><sup><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/feed.xml?view=community-rss&amp;karmaThreshold=30#fn5pe16miuryo">[2]</a></sup></span>.&nbsp;</p><p>In our CiS paper we theoretically probe the question of whether the efficient linear encoding of sparse data provided by superposition can extend to an efficient compression of a <i>computation</i> involving sparse data (and we find that indeed this is possible, at least in theory).

First, the nonlinearity is applied in the hidden layer (as is more conventional) rather than in the last layer as in that work. Second and crucially, while the TMS task's hidden layer (where superposition occurs) is 2-dimensional, we are interested in contexts where the hidden layer is itself high-dimensional (though not as large as the input and output layers), as this is the context where the compressibility benefit from compressed sensing really shine. Less essentially, our data has noise (rather than being a straight autoencoder as in TMS), and the loss is modified to avoid a degeneracy of MSE loss in this setting.</p><h3>The task: details</h3><p>At the end of the day the task we want our neural net to try to learn is as follows.</p><p><strong>Input</strong>: our input in <span class="mjpage"><span class="mjx-chtml"><span class="mjx-math"><span class="mjx-mrow"><span class="mjx-msubsup"><span class="mjx-base"><span class="mjx-texatom"><span class="mjx-mrow"><span class="mjx-mi"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-ams-R">R</span></span></span></span></span><span class="mjx-sup" style="font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: 0.615em; padding-left: 0px;"><span class="mjx-mi"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I">d</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> is a sparse boolean vector plus noise, <span class="mjpage"><span class="mjx-chtml"><span class="mjx-math"><span class="mjx-mrow"><span class="mjx-msubsup"><span class="mjx-base"><span class="mjx-mi"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I">x</span></span></span><span class="mjx-sup" style="font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: 0.513em; padding-left: 0px;"><span class="mjx-mo"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R">∗</span></span></span></span><span class="mjx-mo MJXc-space2"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R">+</span></span><span class="mjx-mi MJXc-space2"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I">ξ</span></span></span></span></span></span> (here in experiments, <span class="mjpage"><span class="mjx-chtml"><span class="mjx-math"><span class="mjx-mrow"><span class="mjx-msubsup"><span class="mjx-base"><span class="mjx-mi"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I">x</span></span></span><span class="mjx-sup" style="font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: 0.513em; padding-left: 0px;"><span class="mjx-mo"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R">∗</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> is a 2-hot or 3-hot vector, so something like <span class="mjpage"><span class="mjx-chtml"><span class="mjx-math"><span class="mjx-mrow"><span class="mjx-mi"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I">x</span></span><span class="mjx-mo MJXc-space3"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R">=</span></span><span class="mjx-mo MJXc-space3"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R">(</span></span><span class="mjx-mn"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R">0</span></span><span class="mjx-mo"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R">,</span></span><span class="mjx-mn MJXc-space1"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R">0</span></span><span class="mjx-mo"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R">,</span></span><span class="mjx-mn MJXc-space1"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R">1</span></span><span class="mjx-mo"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R">,</span></span><span class="mjx-mn MJXc-space1"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R">0</span></span><span class="mjx-mo"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R">,</span></span><span class="mjx-mn MJXc-space1"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R">0</span></span><span class="mjx-mo"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R">,</span></span><span class="mjx-mn MJXc-space1"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R">0</span></span><span class="mjx-mo"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R">,</span></span><span class="mjx-mn MJXc-space1"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R">1</span></span><span class="mjx-mo"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R">,</span></span><span class="mjx-mn MJXc-space1"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R">0</span></span><span class="mjx-mo"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R">)</span></span></span></span></span></span> and <span class="mjpage"><span class="mjx-chtml"><span class="mjx-math"><span class="mjx-mrow"><span class="mjx-mi"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I">ξ</span></span></span></span></span></span> is Gaussian noise which is standard deviation <span class="mjpage"><span class="mjx-chtml"><span class="mjx-math"><span class="mjx-mrow"><span class="mjx-mo"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R">≪</span></span><span class="mjx-mn MJXc-space3"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R">1</span></span></span></span></span></span> on a coordinatewise level).

The two models are chosen in such a way that the total number of weights (i.e., the total number of dots in the diagram) is the same in both.&nbsp;</p><p>Both images represent a (single) local minimum in the weight landscape, and they have a similar coarse structure, comprising a set of several clusters of similar shape (if you zoom in, you can see that the decoder weights end up scaled differently and the encoder weights are distributed differently between the bumps – we can predict these differences from a theoretical model). But we also see a very stark visual difference between the two sets of weights. The model on the left seems to converge to a highly symmetric set of weights with just 5 allowable coefficient values in the encoder and decoder (up to small noise from numerical imperfections). But despite having the same symmetries a priori, the weights of the model on the right have only a coarse regularity: locally within clusters they look essentially random. In fact in a theoretical model that is guiding my experiments here, we can predict that in an appropriate asymptotic limit, the perturbations around the cluster centers will converge to Gaussian noise.&nbsp;</p><p>This noisy structure is a neural-net consequence of a frustrated equilibrium associated with superposition. I'll explain this in the next section.</p><h1>The physics of frustration</h1><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometrical_frustration">Frustration</a> is one of several ways in statistical physics that can lead to <i>quenched randomness</i>. By its very nature, statistical physics deals with phenomena with randomness and noise. The sources of randomness can roughly be separated into: on the one hand, <i>fluctuation phenomena</i> experienced by systems at positive temperature (think of the random distribution of gas particles in a box). And on the other hand, <i>quenched</i> or <i>frozen</i> phenomena, which subject the physical forces <i>defining</i> the system of interest to random perturbations or fields that are stable at relevant time or energy scales. As an example, think of the frozen random nature of the ocean floor. While it changes over millennia, physicists model the peaks and troughs of the bottom as a <i>quenched</i> random structure which is fixed when studying its effect on wave statistics.</p><p>In this work I'm most interested in a special kind of quenched randomness. Quenched structure typically comes about in two ways.</p><ol><li>As an externally imposed source of randomness that is frozen "at the outset" when defining the problem. For example the random peaks and valleys in the ocean floor in my example of understanding waves is of this type. Another classic field with external quenched randomness is the study of semiconductors. Here impurities in a metal affect the electron conduction properties in locally random ways that can be well-understood macroscopically using the theory of quenched disorder.</li><li>As an <i>emergent</i> or self-organizing phenomenon, where the system has no frozen random structure at the outset, but parts of the system spontaneously self-organize into frozen structures that can be treated as fixed and random. A classic example is the self-organization of the magnetic field of a material (like iron) into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_domain">magnetic domains</a> when subjected to an external magnetic field.</li></ol><p>Since learning combines random and structured phenomena, it is frequently studied as a statistical system. In the next sections I'll explain how the three sources of thermodynamic randomness we discussed: tempering, externally imposed quenched randomness, and emergent frozen disorder, relate to the theory of neural nets and how this is related to the notion of frustration and the present experiment.</p><h2>Tempering and quenched disorder in ML and interpretability</h2><p>Existing interpretability theory deals frequently with both fluctuation randomness associated with heat (tempering) and with externally imposed frozen randomness from <i>data</i>, and the two are frequently studied together. However the spontaneously emerging/ self-organizing form of frozen randomness is less frequently studied (at least to the best of my knowledge).&nbsp;</p><p><i>Fluctuations</i> typically appear in <i>Bayesian learning</i> theory. In many theoretical contexts (especially ones concerned with heuristic bias of NN learning), it is useful to replace the <i>exact</i> loss-minimization goal of a learning algorithm by a <i>tempered</i> setting where we model the learner as converging to a random distribution on the loss landscape where weights with low loss are more likely than weights with higher loss, according to a Boltzmann statistical law. (This is heuristically similar to randomly sampling a "low-loss valley" in the landscape, i.e. randomly selecting a weight with loss <span class="mjpage"><span class="mjx-chtml"><span class="mjx-math"><span class="mjx-mrow"><span class="mjx-mo"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R">&lt;</span></span><span class="mjx-mi MJXc-space3"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I">ϵ</span></span></span></span></span></span> away from minimum.) The amount of "randomness" here is controlled by a parameter called the temperature (it is analogous to the loss cutoff <span class="mjpage"><span class="mjx-chtml"><span class="mjx-math"><span class="mjx-mrow"><span class="mjx-mi"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I">ϵ</span></span></span></span></span></span> in the loss valley picture). Tempered learners can be designed empirically. There is a learning algorithm that is known to converge to this tempered distribution, which is (stochastic) <i>Langevin descent</i>, or SGLD. Here the model learns via a biased random walk with a bias towards low-loss regions<span class="footnote-reference" id="fnrefn8rfc8rk6x"><sup><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/feed.xml?view=community-rss&amp;karmaThreshold=30#fnn8rfc8rk6x">[3]</a></sup></span>.</p><p><i>Externally imposed frozen disorder</i> typically appears in neural net work through the data distribution. When training a model on finite data, the specific datapoints used are assumed to be drawn randomly from a large data distribution. Thus difference between what a model would learn at infinite data vs. what is learned at a small random training set bakes in a source of noise called the <i>data sample noise</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>These two sources of noise are known to be related. In particular in contexts where both are present (Bayesian / Langevin learning on finite data), it is often known roughly which source of randomness dominates. For example in work by <a href="https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume14/watanabe13a/watanabe13a.pdf">Watanabe</a>, it is shown that above a certain scale of tempering (very roughly proportional to the inverse number of datapoints), data randomness becomes small compared to the random noise from tempering, and so the statistics becomes independent of the size of the training set.&nbsp;</p><p>In a similar setting, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06008">Howard et al.</a> use a standard physical tool for studying quenched disorder, called the <i>replica method</i>, to more carefully study a learning system with both data noise and tempered randomness. (The work is done in a very simple linear regression setting, where exact theoretical predictions can be made using renormalization theory. The result finds a similar "transitional scale" to Watanabe's critical temperature range, with a more precise study of exactly how this transition happens.)</p><p>The random cluster structure seen in our experiments is a consequence of a new form of frozen disorder, this time self-organizing (analogous to the self-organizing domains in magnetic iron). In our case the self-organizing structure is a consequence of a particularly interesting and unusual type of chaotic behavior of physical systems, which is called <strong>frustration</strong>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Frustration in physics</h2><p>We have been talking about thermodynamics and physical systems without defining terms. Let's fix this. For me, a (statistical) physical system is a high-dimensional data distribution with a notion of <i>energy</i>. A choice of the data is called a <i>state</i>, and its temperature is a number (that "wants to be small" in a statistical sense). Formally, the probability of a state is determined by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_distribution">Boltzmann distribution</a> at some temperature T. Here (without getting too in the weeds), the temperature determines "how much" the probability distribution is biased to prefer low-energy states. Most importantly for us, at temperature 0 this bias is maximized, and all the probability distribution is concentrated on states that <i>minimize</i> the energy.&nbsp;</p><p>A "prototypical" example is the ferromagnetic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ising_model">Ising model</a>, where the state is a collection of spins <span class="mjpage"><span class="mjx-chtml"><span class="mjx-math"><span class="mjx-mrow"><span class="mjx-mo"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R">±</span></span><span class="mjx-mn"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R">1</span></span></span></span></span></span> indexed by a lattice. We can think of the state as an <span class="mjpage"><span class="mjx-chtml"><span class="mjx-math"><span class="mjx-mrow"><span class="mjx-mi"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I">N</span></span><span class="mjx-mo MJXc-space2"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R">×</span></span><span class="mjx-mi MJXc-space2"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I">N</span></span></span></span></span></span> matrix <span class="mjpage"><span class="mjx-chtml"><span class="mjx-math"><span class="mjx-mrow"><span class="mjx-mi"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I">x</span></span></span></span></span></span> all of whose coordinates are <span class="mjpage"><span class="mjx-chtml"><span class="mjx-math"><span class="mjx-mrow"><span class="mjx-mo"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R">±</span></span><span class="mjx-mn"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R">1</span></span></span></span></span></span>.

It is <i>minus</i> the count of the number of "neighbor pairs" (edges in the lattice) where both neighbors point the same direction (so are either both up or both down). Since models want to minimize energy, the lowest-energy (and thus highest-probability) state is the one where all spins align.&nbsp;</p><p>A related model, called the <i>antiferromagnetic</i> Ising model, is defined similarly but counts the number of <i>anti-aligned</i> pairs (up to a constant, this is just minus the ferromagnetic energy). A minimizer here is the <i>checkerboard pattern</i> of spins:</p><figure class="image image_resized" style="width: 44.84%;"><img alt="Computational Physics" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/siu22scEfuKxpSgfK/ogt0btgiq7m6a7tdmyn3" /><figcaption>In the <strong>antiferromagnetic</strong> model this state is energy-minimizing and energetically favored with energy <strong>-4</strong> (4 "opposite" connections). It has energy <strong>0</strong> in the ferromagnetic model.</figcaption></figure><p>Energy minimizers of a thermodynamic system are called <i>ground states</i>. At temperature T = 0, the probability distribution is concentrated on ground states only. For the ferromagnetic Ising model, this is a probability distribution with 50% probability on the "spin up" ground state (all spins +1) and 50% on the spin down state. The antiferromagnetic model similarly has two ground states related by a sign flip. The "default" expectation is that<span class="footnote-reference" id="fnrefb62hu4w42zq"><sup><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/feed.xml?view=community-rss&amp;karmaThreshold=30#fnb62hu4w42zq">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;there are not very many ground states: that in some sense they form a low-dimensional space of structured distributions that is either unique or at worst controlled by a low-dimensional "macroscopic" parameter.&nbsp;</p><p>This expectation of a low-dimensional set of highly structured ground states is sometimes frustrated<span class="footnote-reference" id="fnrefpvyit8hezj"><sup><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/feed.xml?view=community-rss&amp;karmaThreshold=30#fnpvyit8hezj">[5]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;in an interesting way. In frustrated physical systems, discrete parameters have conflicting energetic preferences that cannot be simultaneously satisfied and cause interesting emergent disorder. The classic example is an anti-ferromagnet with <i>triangular bonds</i>, i.e., a triangular lattice of spins where each pair wants to anti-align.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image image_resized" style="width: 52.91%;"><img alt="Geometrical frustration - Wikipedia" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/siu22scEfuKxpSgfK/bwmm34t0cjbuyhunem6e" /><figcaption>A piece of a triangular &nbsp;antiferromagnetic model where neighboring spins want to anti-align.

Instead the distribution of ground states looks chaotic and high-dimensional. Furthermore it has significant entropy, similar to a "hot" system that is pushed away from its ground state by positive temperature.&nbsp;</p><p>In our sparse denoising model, a similar frustrated energy landscape emerges in the presence of superposition.

The analog of energy is the loss function (always understood in the context of infinite data). In the presence of superposition, part of what the loss is trying to do can be summarized as "trying to orthogonally embed many vectors into a lower-dimensional space" (in our case, it's embedding <span class="mjpage"><span class="mjx-chtml"><span class="mjx-math"><span class="mjx-mrow"><span class="mjx-mi"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I">d</span></span></span></span></span></span> "feature" vectors into an <span class="mjpage"><span class="mjx-chtml"><span class="mjx-math"><span class="mjx-mrow"><span class="mjx-mi"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I">h</span></span></span></span></span></span>-dimensional hidden layer.

Since exact orthogonality is impossible for more than basis-many vectors, there is a potential for frustrated structure. However a priori there is a mismatch: frustrated structures are <i>discrete</i> statements about ground states or minima, but our system is continuous. It may seem hard to say nontrivial things about the discrete structure on the ground states, i.e. exact minima.&nbsp;</p><p>But wait: the model we're studying is sort of discrete, and the evidence is staring us in the eyes.

Indeed, once we fix some "macroscopic" information, namely how many features are processed by 1 neuron, how many are processed by 2 neurons, etc., all that remains are sign flips and permutation symmetries which in this case are <i>global</i> symmetries of the system, and thus don't affect the loss, geometry, etc.&nbsp;</li><li>There is superposition, i.e. <span class="mjpage"><span class="mjx-chtml"><span class="mjx-math"><span class="mjx-mrow"><span class="mjx-mi"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I">h</span></span><span class="mjx-mo MJXc-space3"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R">&lt;</span></span><span class="mjx-mi MJXc-space3"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I">d</span></span></span></span></span></span>.

In other words, since the superposition is explicitly encouraging the matrix coefficients to "not be correlated", the optimal choice is to assume exactly <i>no structure</i>, i.e. random structure. In particular the resulting system is deeply frustrated: the set of vacua is very high-dimensional and has nontrivial entropy.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>Remark</strong>. The "random ground state" model for superpositional systems is simplistic: true vacua likely have some sneaky higher-level structure that we are failing to track that makes some minima slightly better than others, though on small scales that as we'll see are below anything we can control in this context. At the end of the day, the structure we really care about is <i>what gets learned</i> by the learning algorithm. Here we can do various empirical analyses on the weights (e.g. use random graph measurements, or compare the loss in a random basin to the learned loss) to see that an iid random configuration explains the learned minima well.</p><h2>Continuous fluctuations from frozen structure</h2><p>At the end of the day, we have a pair of predictions for the <i>discrete</i> sign structure associated to the context with superposition <span class="mjpage"><span class="mjx-chtml"><span class="mjx-math"><span class="mjx-mrow"><span class="mjx-mo"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R">(</span></span><span class="mjx-mi"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I">h</span></span><span class="mjx-mo MJXc-space3"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R">&lt;</span></span><span class="mjx-mi MJXc-space3"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I">d</span></span><span class="mjx-mo"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R">)</span></span></span></span></span></span> and without superposition <span class="mjpage"><span class="mjx-chtml"><span class="mjx-math"><span class="mjx-mrow"><span class="mjx-mo"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R">(</span></span><span class="mjx-mi"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I">h</span></span><span class="mjx-mo MJXc-space3"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R">&gt;</span></span><span class="mjx-mi MJXc-space3"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I">d</span></span><span class="mjx-mo"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R">)</span></span></span></span></span></span>. Now we are actually interested in the continuous weight values, which we only know are <i>in a basin</i> associated to a discrete centroid. We can think of the resulting system in two equivalent ways: either as a renormalization setting where the small-scale continuous structure perturbs the energy of the discrete configuration, or as a coupled system where the discrete "frozen" structure couples to a smaller-scale "microscopic" system as a background field. The second setting is easier to think about, and puts us back into the context we had discussed in a physics setting, where some predetermined random structure (in this case appearing in an emergent way from the same model) is treated as a "frozen" source of randomness in the system.&nbsp;</p><p>Unpacking this, we see cleanly the difference between the frustrated / superpositional vs. the un-frustrated / single-vacuum settings. In the un-frustrated case, the discrete structure is unique and symmetric. This implies that the continuous perturbations are also symmetric: once we factor in the "macroscopic" information of how many neurons process each feature the weight coordinates are determined uniquely and symmetrically, and the "cluster structure" simplifies to a set of discrete centroids.</p><p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/siu22scEfuKxpSgfK/ye5zzob3anab2jf2n4gs" />&nbsp;</p><p>In the frustrated case, the random structure is not symmetric. Frustration means that already on the level of discrete sign choices, we can find no exact regularities, and some pairs of rows/ columns overlap more than others. This asymmetry couples with the microscopic system of perturbations away from the cluster centroids, and implies that the same kind of asymmetric structure will be observed there. More precisely, since we can model the sign randomness as iid discrete noise, the effect on the microscopic fluctuations of local minima can again be nicely modeled via the central limit theorem as continuous but "frozen" ripple phenomena that randomly perturb the coordinates of the local minimum of a basin in a predictable fashion. This leads to a phenomenon that appears again and again in physics: frustrated or random discrete structure at a large scale generates random continuous perturbations to local minima (and any other geometric structures) on some related smaller scale. The resulting ripples in the energy landscape are sometimes called "pinning fields".</p><p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/siu22scEfuKxpSgfK/szam8dkkjmjhid5arwlq" /></p><p>The random pinning field perturbations explain the surprising noisy structure in the above plot of the weights of the <i>local minimum</i> of our system (analogous to a vacuum in physics). Since we have flattened a pair of matrices into pairs of real numbers, the ordered and symmetric-looking cluster structure here is hiding a frustrated and asymmetric frozen sign pattern. The quenched disorder from this pattern then produces the ripples, or pinning fields, which perturb the local minima away from exact idealized values.&nbsp;</p><p>The theory model I've been carrying around in the background (that I won't explain in this post) actually predicts that the random perturbations in each cluster are Gaussian. In the picture, you can see that this isn't empirically the case. While the central cluster does look like a non-uniform Gaussian, the two corner clusters look like they have some more structure – perhaps a further division into two types of points. Likely this is a combination of some subtle structure beyond randomness that is missed in the naive theory model, and the fact that the model is quite small, probably at the very tail end of applicability of the nice high-dimensional compression properties given by compressed sensing theory. (The model here has hidden dimension <span class="mjpage"><span class="mjx-chtml"><span class="mjx-math"><span class="mjx-mrow"><span class="mjx-mi"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I">h</span></span><span class="mjx-mo MJXc-space3"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R">=</span></span><span class="mjx-mn MJXc-space3"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R">1024</span></span></span></span></span></span> and input, i.e. feature dimension <span class="mjpage"><span class="mjx-chtml"><span class="mjx-math"><span class="mjx-mrow"><span class="mjx-mi"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I">d</span></span><span class="mjx-mo MJXc-space3"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R">=</span></span><span class="mjx-mn MJXc-space3"><span class="mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R">3072</span></span></span></span></span></span>, just a factor of 3 bigger.)</p><h1>Miscellanea: pretty pictures and future questions</h1><p>The interesting non-Gaussian structure in the clusters hints at a depth of phenomena in this simple context whose surface we are only beginning to probe.&nbsp;</p><p>As I mentioned the specific architecture I am looking at is designed theory-first: there is a mean field-inspired picture for getting predictions about the weights of these models which is much simpler in some settings and regimes. Here I am taking a regime designed to be particularly amenable to theory.</p><p>One can ask what would happen if we were to train a sparse denoising model as experimentalists, or at least in some "generic ML way". To explore this I did some experiments where we take a GeLU activation and train on a softmax loss (the most natural choice since I explained that straight MSE loss finds degenerate solutions here).&nbsp;</p><p>The model ends up learning the following weight configuration:</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/siu22scEfuKxpSgfK/nhgdc5c9zuksns0kkwam" /></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Here there is still some heuristic theory of what is happening which models it as a mix of Gaussian blobs. However in this case it is no longer reasonable to expect the weight pairs to be chosen independently from the blobs in this two-dimensional picture. The neuron pairs in the small partially-obscured blob in the lower left are actually coupled, or correlated with the "cloud" blob in the upper right corner, so the "true blobs" are 4-dimensional. The fancy way of saying this is that the mean field theory here becomes a 2-particle mean field theory. Of course the idealized mean field picture here again is at best a heuristic approximation. For example we see extra emergent stratification structure in the different components that is probably seeing some additional structure that the mean field approximation fails to take into account. Similarly to the setting from the rest of the paper, I expect the empirical outputs to agree more closely with the idealized 2-particle mean field in the limit of higher dimensions.</p><p>Aesthetically, I found it fun to see how the model gets trained: to me it looks like a cannon shooting at a cloud. You can see this in <a href="https://imgur.com/a/RpS2pBG">this imgur link</a>.</p><p>You get interesting diagrams when you run the experiments in settings that are just on the boundary between superposition and no superposition. Here it seems that while there may be a small amount of frustration, there is also some sophisticated regular structure that I don't know how to model. For example here is an image with embedding dimension 768 and hidden dimension 512, also with gelu activation and softmax loss:</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/siu22scEfuKxpSgfK/zgyy0x7vrldcapxbpugh" /></figure><p>You can see these experiments in <a href="https://github.com/mvaintrob/clean-denoising-experiments">https://github.com/mvaintrob/clean-denoising-experiments</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>As next steps for this project, I am interested in looking at settings with features of different importance, size, or noise, or with additional correlations. I think this can be an interesting source of experimental settings with more than two relevant scales. I've run a couple of experiments with different feature types like the one below, but haven't come up with a setting that is both experimentally and theoretically nice.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/siu22scEfuKxpSgfK/iu4hxje4wnfnbbxmb7uf" /></figure><p>I am also very interested in looking at more general sparse computation settings and settings with more than two layers, where apart from denoising, a model learns a boolean task on a model with superposition. Some promising experiments in this direction have been done in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15318">Adler-Shavit</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Me and my team at PIBBSS are always looking for collaborators and informal collaborations.

It's possible to serve up dozens or hundreds of examples of a scary thing per day, without that thing actually being objectively scary or abnormal. (See: </span><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/DSzpr8Y9299jdDLc9/cardiologists-and-chinese-robbers"><span>Cardiologists and Chinese Robbers</span></a><span>)</span></p><p><span>Elizabeth and I wanted to get some sense of how unusual and how bad Trump’s actions are. “How bad” feels like a very complex question with lots of room for judgment. “How unusual” seemed a bit more likely to have an ~objective answer.</span></p><p><span>I asked LLMs some basic questions about it, but wanted a more thorough answer. I was about to spin up ~250 subagents to go run searches on each individual year of American history, querying for things like “[year] [president name] ‘executive overreach’” or “[year] [president name] ‘disobeying court order’”, and fill up a CSV with incidents.</span></p><p><span>That seemed… like it was approaching a methodology that might (with addititional workshopping) be cruxy for some Trump supporters or Trump-neutral-ers. It seemed like maybe good practice to ask if there were any ways to operationalize this question that’d be cruxy for anyone else. And, generally pre-register it before running the query, making some advance predictions.</span></p><p><span>[ETA] Of course, I know for many Trump supporters, the whole point is that he's destroying a bunch of institutions that need destroying. I am actually pretty sympathetic to the idea that if you want a better government, you need to tear down the old one quickly. There might be enough differences of values here that there's not much common ground to be had, but for me, the crux is that he seems to:</span></p><ul><li><span>Not merely be tearing down various bureaucracies, but, eroding norms like "there is supposed to be rule of law, generally."</span></li><li><span>It does not look like this is laying the way for anything good to follow, it looks like it's just kinda making a more corrupt world.</span></li></ul><p><span>But, I'm aware the world is already pretty corrupt, and there's generally been a trend of executive overreach for awhile. It wouldn't be too surprising if my intuitions here are just way off.</span></p><p><span>Each operationalization I’ve thought of so far seems a bit confused/wrong/incomplete. I feel okay with settling for “the least confused/wrong options I can come up with after a day of thinking about it," but, I'm interested in suggestions for better ones.</span></p><p><span>Some examples so far that feel like they're at least relevant:</span></p><ul><li><span>How many incidents will an LLM find of a president ignoring a court order?</span></li><li><span>How many executive orders did they issue?</span></li><li><span>How many pardons did they grant? Do any pardons have evidence of being paid?</span></li><li><span>What was their wealth level before and after serving (perhaps normed by economic growth, or wealth change of congressmen)?</span></li><li><span>How many troops deployed without Congressional authorization?</span></li><li><span>How many incidents that "got heavy criticism of executive overreach" that don't really fit into a specific category?</span></li></ul><p><span>These questions all have the form "checking if allegations by detractors about Trump are true", which isn't necessarily the frame by which someone would defend Trump, or the set of questions that'd be most salient to them. If you're trying to build a complete picture of what's going on, you probably also want to ask questions like:</span></p><ul><li><span>How many nationwide injunctions did federal courts issue per year / per administration, and what were they blocking?</span></li><li><span>How often did SCOTUS use emergency orders to pause/restore major federal policies (stays, injunctions, admin stays) per term?</span></li></ul><p><span>I also don't know that any of this is really the right frame for actually answering my own question of "is the US in a period of rapid decline in a way that's a plausible top priority for me or others to focus on?"</span></p><p><span>None of them really get at things like "tweeting a picture of yourself wearing a crown", which feels intuitively fairly bad to me but I'm not really sure how to think about that.</span></p><p><span>I'm interested in whether people have more suggestions for questions that seem relevant and easy to check. Or, suggestions on how to operationalize fuzzier things that might not fit into the "measure it per year" ontology.</span></p><p><br /></p><h1><span>Appendix: Subagents Ahoy</span></h1><p><span>A lot of these are recorded in places that are pretty straightforward to look up. </span><span><span>i.e</span></span><span>. there's already lists of </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_pardoned_or_granted_clemency_by_the_president_of_the_United_States" rel="noreferrer"><span>Pardons per President</span></a><span>, and </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order" rel="noreferrer"><span>Executive Orders per president</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>But, I have an AI-subagent process I'm experimenting with that I expect to use for at least some of these, which currently goes something like:</span></p><ul><li><span>Have a (dumb) Cursor AI agent make one spreadsheet of "incidents" where rows are "years of US history", there's a column for "what incident type are we talking about?"

### [Fragments: January 22](https://martinfowler.com/fragments/2026-01-22.html)

**来源**: Martin Fowler

**摘要**: <p>My colleagues here at Thoughtworks have announced <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/ai/works">AI/works™</a>, a platform for our work using AI-enabled software development. The platform is in its early days, and is currently intended to support Thoughtworks consultants in their client work. I’m looking forward to sharing what we learn from using and further developing the platform in future months.</p>

<p>Simon Couch <a href="https://www.simonpcouch.com/blog/2026-01-20-cc-impact/">examines the electricity consumption</a> of using AI. He’s a heavy user: “usually programming for a few hours, and driving 2 or 3 Claude Code instances at a time”. He finds his usage of electricity is orders of magnitude more than typical estimates based on the “typical query”.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On a median day, I estimate I consume 1,300 Wh through Claude Code—4,400 “typical queries” worth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But it’s still not a massive amount of power - similar to that of running a dishwasher.</p>

<p>A caveat to this is that this is “napkin math” because we don’t have decent data about how these models use resources. I agree with him that we ought to.</p>

<p> ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p>My namesake Chad Fowler (no relation) considers that the movement to agentic coding creates a similar <a href="https://aicoding.leaflet.pub/3mbrvhyye4k2e">shift in rigor and discipline</a> as appeared in Extreme Programming, dynamic languages, and continuous deployment.</p>

<p>In Extreme Programming’s case, this meant a lot of discipline around testing, continuous integration, and keeping the code-base healthy. My current view is that with AI-enabled development we need to be rigorous about evaluating the software, both for its observable behavior and its internal quality.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The engineers who thrive in this environment will be the ones who relocate discipline rather than abandon it. They’ll treat generation as a capability that demands more precision in specification, not less. They’ll build evaluation systems that are harder to fool than the ones they replaced. They’ll refuse the temptation to mistake velocity for progress.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p>There’s been much written about the dreadful events in Minnesota, and I’ve not felt I’ve had anything useful to add to them. But I do want to pass on an excellent post from <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/why-are-federal-agents-gunning-down">Noah Smith</a> that captures many of my thoughts. He points out that there is a “consistent record of brutality, aggression, dubious legality, and unprofessionalism” from ICE (and CBP) who seem to be turning into MAGA’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturmabteilung">SD</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is this America now? A country where unaccountable and poorly trained government agents go door to door, arresting and beating people on pure suspicion, and shooting people who don’t obey their every order or who try to get away? “When a federal officer gives you instructions, you abide by them and then you get to keep your life” is a perfect description of an authoritarian police state. None of this is Constitutional, every bit of it is deeply antithetical to the American values we grew up taking for granted.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My worries about these kinds of developments were what animated me to urge against voting for Trump in the <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/vote-against-trump.html">2016 election</a>. Mostly those worries didn’t come to fruition because enough constitutional Republicans were in a position to stop them from happening, so even when Trump attempted a coup in 2020, he wasn’t able to get very far. But now those constitutional Republicans are absent or quiescent. I fear that what we’ve seen in Minneapolis will be a harbinger of worse to come.</p>

<p>I also second John Gruber’s <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2026/01/lets_call_a_murder_a_murder">praise of bystander Caitlin Callenson</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But then, after the murderous agent fired three shots — just 30 or 40 feet in front of Callenson — Callenson had the courage and conviction to stay with the scene and keep filming. Not to run away, but instead to follow the scene. To keep filming. To continue documenting with as best clarity as she could, what was unfolding.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The recent activity in  Venezuala reminds me that I’ve long felt that Trump is a Hugo Chávez figure - a charismatic populist who’s keen on wrecking institutions and norms. Trump is old, so won’t be with us for that much longer - but the question is: “who is Trump’s Maduro?”</p>

<p> ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p>With all the drama at home, we shouldn’t ignore the terrible things that happened in Iran. The people there again suffered again the consequences of an entrenched authoritarian police state.</p>

### [Conversation: LLMs and the what/how loop](https://martinfowler.com/articles/convo-what-how.html)

**来源**: Martin Fowler

**摘要**: <p>A conversation between <b class="author">Unmesh Joshi</b>, <b class="author">Rebecca
      Parsons</b>, and <b class="author">Martin Fowler</b> on how LLMs help us
      shape the abstractions in our software. We view our challenge as building
      systems that survive change, requiring us to manage our cognitive load. We
      can do this by mapping the &#x201c;what&#x201d; of we want our software to do into the
      &#x201c;how&#x201d; of programming languages. This &#x201c;what&#x201d; and &#x201c;how&#x201d; are built up in a
      feedback loop. TDD helps us operationalize that loop, and LLMs allow us to
      explore that loop in an informal and more fluid manner.</p>

<p><b class="author">Jim Highsmith</b> notes that many teams have turned into
      tribes wedded to exclusively adaptation or optimization. But he feels this
      misses the point that both of these are important, and we need to manage
      the tension between them. We can do this by thinking of two operating
      modes: explore (adaptation-dominant) and exploit (optimization dominant).
      We tailor a team's operating model to a particular blend of the two -
      considering uncertainty, risk, cost of change, and an evidence threshold.
      We should be particularly careful at the points where there is a handoff
      between the two modes</p>

### [Fragments: January  8](https://martinfowler.com/fragments/2026-01-08.html)

**来源**: Martin Fowler

**摘要**: <p>Anthropic report on <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/how-ai-is-transforming-work-at-anthropic">how their AI is changing their own software development practice</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Most usage is for debugging and helping understand existing code</li>
  <li>Notable increase in using it for implementing new features</li>
  <li>Developers using it for 59% of their work and getting 50% productivity increase</li>
  <li>14% of developers are “power users” reporting much greater gains</li>
  <li>Claude helps developers to work outside their core area</li>
  <li>Concerns about changes to the profession, career evolution, and social dynamics</li>
</ul>

<p> ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p>Much of the discussion about using LLMs for software development lacks details on workflow. Rather than just hear people gush about how wonderful it is, I want to understand the gritty details. What kinds of interactions occur with the LLM? What decisions do the humans make? When reviewing LLM outputs, what kinds of things are the humans looking for, what corrections do they make?</p>

<p><a href="https://obie.medium.com/what-used-to-take-months-now-takes-days-cc8883cc21e9">Obie Fernandez</a> has written a post that goes into these kinds of details. Over the Christmas / New Year period he used Claude to build a knowledge distillation application, that takes transcripts from Claude Code sessions, slack discussion, github PR threads etc, turns them into an RDF graph database, and provides a web app with natural language ways to query them.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Not a proof of concept. Not a demo. The first cut of Nexus, a production-ready system with authentication, semantic search, an MCP server for agent access, webhook integrations for our primary SaaS platforms, comprehensive test coverage, deployed, integrated and ready for full-scale adoption at my company this coming Monday. Nearly 13,000 lines of code.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The article is long, but worth the time to read it.</p>

<p>An important feature of his workflow is relying on <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestDrivenDevelopment.html">Test-Driven Development</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here’s what made this sustainable rather than chaotic: TDD. Test-driven development. For most of the features, I insisted that Claude Code follow the red-green-refactor cycle with me. Write a failing test first. Make it pass with the simplest implementation. Then refactor while keeping tests green.</p>

  <p>This wasn’t just methodology purism. TDD served a critical function in AI-assisted development: it kept me in the loop. When you’re directing thousands of lines of code generation, you need a forcing function that makes you actually understand what’s being built. Tests are that forcing function. You can’t write a meaningful test for something you don’t understand. And you can’t verify that a test correctly captures intent without understanding the intent yourself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The account includes a major refactoring, and much evolution of the initial version of the tool. It’s also an interesting glimpse of how AI tooling may finally make RDF useful.</p>

<p> ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p>When thinking about requirements for software, most discussions focus on prioritization. Some folks talk about buckets such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method">MoSCoW set</a>: Must, Should, Could, and Want. (The old joke being that, in MoSCoW, the cow is silent, because hardly any requirements end up in those buckets.) <a href="https://world.hey.com/jason/the-obvious-the-easy-and-the-possible-2e11a3fb">Jason Fried</a> has a different set of buckets for interface design: <strong>Obvious, Easy, and Possible</strong>. This immediately resonates with me: a good way of think about how to allocate the cognitive costs for those who use a tool.</p>

<p> ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p><a href="https://www.platformer.news/fake-uber-eats-whisleblower-hoax-debunked/">Casey Newton</a> explains how he followed up on an interesting story of dark patterns in food delivery, and found it to be a fake story, buttressed by AI image and document creation. On one hand, it clarifies the important role reporters play in exposing lies that get traction on the internet. But time taken to do this is time not spent on investigating real stories</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For most of my career up until this point, the document shared with me by the whistleblower would have seemed highly credible in large part because it would have taken so long to put together. Who would take the time to put together a detailed, 18-page technical document about market dynamics just to troll a reporter? Who would go to the trouble of creating a fake badge?</p>

  <p>Today, though, the report can be generated within minutes, and the badge within seconds. And while no good reporter would ever have published a story based on a single document and an unknown source, plenty would take the time to investigate the document’s contents and see whether human sources would back it up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The internet has always been full of slop, and we have always needed to be wary of what we read there. AI now makes it easy to manufacture convincing looking evidence, and this is never more dangerous than when it confirms strongly held beliefs and fears.</p>

<p> ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7413956151144542208/">Kent Beck</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The descriptions of Spec-Driven development that I have seen emphasize writing the whole specification before implementation. This encodes the (to me bizarre) assumption that you aren’t going to learn anything during implementation that would change the specification.
I’ve heard this story so many times told so many ways by well-meaning folks–if only we could get the specification “right”, the rest of this would be easy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Like him, that story has been the constant background siren to my career in tech. But the <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/llm-learning-loop.html">learning loop</a> of experimentation is essential to the model building that’s at the heart of any kind of worthwhile specification. As <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/llm-learning-loop.html">Unmesh puts it:</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Large Language Models give us great leverage—but they only work if we focus on learning and understanding. They make it easier to explore ideas, to set things up, to translate intent into code across many specialized languages. But the real capability—our ability to respond to change—comes not from how fast we can produce code, but from how deeply we understand the system we are shaping.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When Kent defined Extreme Programming, he made <em>feedback</em> one of its four core values. It strikes me that the key to making the full use of AI in software development is how to use it to accelerate the feedback loops.</p>

<p> ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p>As I listen to people who are serious with AI-assisted programming, the crucial thing I hear is managing context. Programming-oriented tools are geting more sophisticated for that, but there’s also efforts at providing simpler tools, that allow customization. <a href="https://lixo.org">Carlos Villela</a> recently recommended Pi, and its developer, <a href="https://mariozechner.at/posts/2025-11-30-pi-coding-agent/">Mario Zechner, has an interesting blog</a> on its development.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So what’s an old guy yelling at Claudes going to do? He’s going to write his own coding agent harness and give it a name that’s entirely un-Google-able, so there will never be any users. Which means there will also never be any issues on the GitHub issue tracker. How hard can it be?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If I ever get the time to sit and really play with these tools, then something like Pi would be something I’d like to try out. Although as an addict to The One True Editor, I’m interested in some of libraries that work with that, such as <a href="https://github.com/karthink/gptel">gptel</a>. That would enable me to use Emacs’s inherent programability to create my own command set to drive the interaction with LLMs.</p>

<p> ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p>Outside of my professional work, I’ve <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/blog/13064/martins-7th-decade">posting regularly about my boardgaming</a> on the specialist site BoardGameGeek. However its blogging environment doesn’t do a good job of providing an index to my posts, so I’ve created <a href="https://martinfowler.com/boardgames/">a list of my BGG posts </a> on my own site.

<p>Gergely Orosz on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gergely.pragmaticengineer.com/post/3m7xd33hi5c2d">social media</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unpopular opinion:</p>

  <p>Current code review tools just don’t make much sense for AI-generated code</p>

  <p>When reviewing code I really want to know:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The prompt made by the dev</li>
    <li>What corrections the other dev made to the code</li>
    <li>Clear marking of code AI-generated not changed by a human</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Some people pushed back saying they don’t (and shouldn’t care) whether it was written by a human, generated by an LLM, or copy-pasted from Stack Overflow.</p>

<p>In my view it matters <em>a lot</em> - because of the second vital purpose of code review.</p>

<p>When asked why do code reviews, most people will answer the first vital purpose - quality control. We want to ensure bad code gets blocked before it hits <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/branching-patterns.html#mainline">mainline</a>. We do this to avoid bugs and to avoid other quality issues, in particular comprehensibility and ease of change.</p>

<p>But I hear the second vital purpose less often: code review is a mechanism to communicate and educate. If I’m submitting some sub-standard code, and it gets rejected, I want to know why so that I can improve my programming. Maybe I’m unaware of some library features, or maybe there’s some project-specific standards I haven’t run into yet, or maybe my naming isn’t as clear as I thought it was. Whatever the reasons, I need to know in order to learn. And my employer needs me to learn, so I can be more effective.</p>

<p>We need to know the writer of the code we review both so we can communicate our better practice to them, but also to know how to improve things. With a human, its a conversation, and perhaps some documentation if we realize we’ve needed to explain things repeatedly. But with an LLM it’s about how to modify its context, as well as humans learning how to better drive the LLM.</p>

<p> ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p>Wondering why I’ve been making a lot of posts like this recently? <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/writing-fragments.html">I explain why</a> I’ve been reviving the link blog.</p>

<p> ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p><a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/10/html-tools/">Simon Willison</a> describes how he uses LLMs to build disposable but useful web apps</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>These are the characteristics I have found to be most productive in building tools of this nature:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>A single file: inline JavaScript and CSS in a single HTML file means the least hassle in hosting or distributing them, and crucially means you can copy and paste them out of an LLM response.</li>
    <li>Avoid React, or anything with a build step. The problem with React is that JSX requires a build step, which makes everything massively less convenient. I prompt “no react” and skip that whole rabbit hole entirely.</li>
    <li>Load dependencies from a CDN. The fewer dependencies the better, but if there’s a well known library that helps solve a problem I’m happy to load it from CDNjs or jsdelivr or similar.</li>
    <li>Keep them small. A few hundred lines means the maintainability of the code doesn’t matter too much: any good LLM can read them and understand what they’re doing, and rewriting them from scratch with help from an LLM takes just a few minutes.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>His repository includes all these tools, together with transcripts of the chats that got the LLMs to build them.</p>

<p> ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p><a href="https://obie.medium.com/what-happens-when-the-coding-becomes-the-least-interesting-part-of-the-work-ab10c213c660">Obie Fernandez</a>: while many engineers are underwhelmed by AI tools, some senior engineers are finding them really valuable. He feels that senior engineers have an oft-unspoken mindset, which in conjunction with an LLM, enables the LLM to be much more valuable.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Levels of abstraction and generalization problems get talked about a lot because they’re easy to name. But they’re far from the whole story.</p>

  <p>Other tools show up just as often in real work:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>A sense for blast radius. Knowing which changes are safe to make loudly and which should be quiet and contained.</li>
    <li>A feel for sequencing. Knowing when a technically correct change is still wrong because the system or the team isn’t ready for it yet.</li>
    <li>An instinct for reversibility. Preferring moves that keep options open, even if they look less elegant in the moment.</li>
    <li>An awareness of social cost. Recognizing when a clever solution will confuse more people than it helps.</li>
    <li>An allergy to false confidence. Spotting places where tests are green but the model is wrong.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p> ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p><a href="https://friendlybit.com/python/writing-justhtml-with-coding-agents/">Emil Stenström</a> built an HTML5 parser in python using coding agents, using Github Copilot in Agent mode with Claude Sonnet 3.7. He automatically approved most commands. It took him “a couple of months on off-hours”, including at least one restart from scratch. The parser now passes all the tests in html5lib test suite.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After writing the parser, I still don’t know HTML5 properly. The agent wrote it for me. I guided it when it came to API design and corrected bad decisions at the high level, but it did ALL of the gruntwork and wrote all of the code.</p>

  <p>I handled all git commits myself, reviewing code as it went in. I didn’t understand all the algorithmic choices, but I understood when it didn’t do the right thing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although he gives an overview of what happens, there’s not very much information on his workflow and how he interacted with the LLM. There’s certainly not enough detail here to try to replicate his approach. This is contrast to Simon Willison (above) who has detailed links to his chat transcripts - although they are much smaller tools and I haven’t looked at them properly to see how useful they are.</p>

<p>One thing that is clear, however, is the vital need for a comprehensive test suite. Much of his work is driven by having that suite as a clear guide for him and the LLM agents.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>JustHTML is about 3,000 lines of Python with 8,500+ tests passing. I couldn’t have written it this quickly without the agent.</p>

  <p>But “quickly” doesn’t mean “without thinking.” I spent a lot of time reviewing code, making design decisions, and steering the agent in the right direction. The agent did the typing; I did the thinking.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>                                  ❄                                  ❄    </p>

<p>Then Simon Willison <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/15/porting-justhtml/">ported the library to JavaScript</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Time elapsed from project idea to finished library: about 4 hours, during which I also bought and decorated a Christmas tree with family and watched the latest Knives Out movie.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of his lessons:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you can reduce a problem to a robust test suite you can set a coding agent loop loose on it with a high degree of confidence that it will eventually succeed. I called this <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/30/designing-agentic-loops/">designing the agentic loop</a> a few months ago. I think it’s the key skill to unlocking the potential of LLMs for complex tasks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Our experience at Thoughtworks backs this up. We’ve been doing a fair bit of work recently in legacy modernization (mainframe and otherwise) using AI to migrate substantial software systems. Having a robust test suite is necessary (but not sufficient) to making this work. I hope to share my colleagues’ experiences on this in the coming months.</p>

<p>But before I leave Willison’s post, I should highlight his final open questions on the legalities, ethics, and effectiveness of all this - they are well-worth contemplating.</p>

### [Writing Fragments](https://martinfowler.com/articles/writing-fragments.html)

**来源**: Martin Fowler

**摘要**: <p>If you’re a regular reader of my site, you’ll have noticed that in the
last few months I’ve been making a <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/20251204-frags.html">number</a> of “fragments” <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/2025-11-19-frags.html">posts</a>. Such a post
is a short post with a bunch of little, unconnected segments. These are
usually a reference to something I’ve found on the web, sometimes a small
thought of my own.</p>

<p>A few years ago, I wouldn’t have covered these topics with posts on my
own site. Instead I would use Twitter, either retweeting someone else’s
point, or just highlighting something I’d found. But since the Muskover,
Twitter has effectively died. I’m not saying that due to any technical
issues with the site, which has mostly just been fine, nor directly due to
any of the policy changes there. The point is that lots of people have left, so that
the audience I would have reached with Twitter is now fragmented. Some
remain on X, but I see more activity on LinkedIn. There’s also Fediverse/Mastodon
and Bluesky.</p>

<p>What this means for short posts is that I can no longer just post in one
place. When I announce new articles on martinfowler.com, I announce now on
four social media sites (X, LinkedIn, Fediverse, and Bluesky). It makes
sense to do this, but I don’t want to go through all this hassle for the
kind of micro-post that Twitter served so well.</p>

<p>So I’ve started to batch them up. When I see something interesting, I
make a note. When I have enough notes, I post a fragments post. Initially I
did this in a rather ad-hoc way, just using the same mechanisms I use for
most articles, but last week I started to put in some more deliberate
mechanisms into the site. (If you’re observant, you’ll spot that in the URLs.)</p>

<p>One benefit of all of this, at least in my book, is that it means my material is
now fully visible in RSS. I’m probably showing my age, but I’m a big fan of RSS
(or in my case, strictly Atom) feeds. I miss the feel of the heyday of the
“blogosphere” before it got steamrolled by social media, and these fragment
posts are, of course, just the same as the link blogs from that era. I still use my
RSS reader every day to keep up with writers I like. (I’m pleased that Substack
makes its content available via RSS.) It bothered me a bit that my micro-founts
of Twitter knowledge weren’t visible on RSS, but was too lazy to do something
about it. Now I don’t need to - the fragments are available in my RSS feed.</p>

**摘要**: <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/03/magazine/chatbot-writing-style.html?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">Why does AI write like… that</a> (NYT, gift link). Sam Kriss delves into the quiet hum of AI writing. AI’s work is not compelling prose: it’s phantom text, ghostly scribblings, a spectre woven into our communal tapestry.</p>

<p><a href="https://coding-is-like-cooking.info/2025/12/test-desiderata-2-0/">Emily Bache</a> has written a set of Test Desiderata, building on some earlier writing from Kent Beck. She lists the characteristics of good tests, and how they support her four “macro desiderata” - the properties of a sound test suite</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Predict success in production</li>
    <li>Fast to get feedback</li>
    <li>Support ongoing code design change</li>
    <li>Low total cost of ownership</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>She also has a great list of other writers’ lists of good test characteristics.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.techpolicy.press/the-eus-fine-against-x-is-not-about-speech-or-censorship/">Daphne Keller</a> explains that the EUs fines on X aren’t about free speech.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are three charges against X, which all stem from a multi-year investigation that was launched in 2023. One is about verification — X’s blue checkmarks on user accounts — and two are about transparency. These charges have nothing to do with what content is on X, or what user speech the platform should or should not allow.</p>

<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/12/05/pop-that-bubble/#u-washington">Cory Doctorow</a> The Reverse-Centaur’s Guide to Criticizing AI</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Start with what a reverse centaur is. In automation theory, a “centaur” is a person who is assisted by a machine. … And obviously, a reverse centaur is machine head on a human body, a person who is serving as a squishy meat appendage for an uncaring machine.</p>

  <p>Like an Amazon delivery driver… the van can’t drive itself and can’t get a parcel from the curb to your porch. The driver is a peripheral for a van, and the van drives the driver, at superhuman speed, demanding superhuman endurance.</p>

**摘要**: <p><a href="https://blog.robbowley.net/2025/12/04/ai-is-still-making-code-worse-a-new-cmu-study-confirms/">Rob Bowley</a> summarizes a study from Carnegie Mellon looking on the impact of AI on a bunch of open-source software projects. Like any such study, we shouldn’t take its results as definitive, but there seems enough there to make it a handy data point. The key point is that the AI code probably reduced the quality of the code base - at least if static code analysis can be trusted to determine quality. And perhaps some worrying second-order effects</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This study shows more than 800 popular GitHub projects with code quality degrading after adopting AI tools. It’s hard not to see a form of context collapse playing out in real time. If the public code that future models learn from is becoming more complex and less maintainable, there’s a real risk that newer models will reinforce and amplify those trends, producing even worse code over time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p>Rob’s post is typical of much of the thoughtful writing on AI. We can see its short-term benefits, but worry about its long-term impact. But on a much deeper note is this lovely story from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/my-80th-birthday-i-bought-myself-new-brain-jim-highsmith-8qcrc/">Jim Highsmith</a>. Jim has turned 0x50, and has spent the last decade fighting Parkinson’s disease. To help him battle it he has two AI assisted allies.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Between my neural implants and Byron’s digital guidance, I now collaborate with two adaptive systems: one for motion, one for thought. Neither replaces me. Both extend me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>If you read anything on AI this week, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/my-80th-birthday-i-bought-myself-new-brain-jim-highsmith-8qcrc/">make it be this</a>.</strong> It offers a positive harbinger for our future and opens my mind to a whole different perspective of the role of AI in it</p>

<p> ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p>Anthropic recently announced that it disrupted a Chinese state-sponsored operation abusing Claude Code. Jim Gumbley looks at the core lesson to learn from this, that we have to understand the serious risk of  <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/security/anthropic-ai-espionage-disclosure-signal-from-noise?utm_source=linkedin&amp;utm_medium=social-organic&amp;utm_campaign=dt_bs_rp-in-clt_tech_thought_leaders_2025-11&amp;gh_src=d1fe17bc1us">AI Jailbreaking</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>New AI tools are able to analyze your attack surface at the next level of granularity. As a business leader, that means you now have two options: wait for someone else to run AI-assisted vulnerability detection against your attack surface, or run it yourself first.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p>There’s plenty of claims that AI Vibe Coding can replace software developers, something that folks like me (perhaps with a bias) think unlikely. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gergely.pragmaticengineer.com/post/3m75kmb7bh22i">Gergely Orosz</a> shared this tidbit</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Talked with an exec at a tech company who is obsessed with AI and has been for 3 years. Not a developer but company makes software. Uses AI for everything, vibe codes ideas.</p>

  <p>Here’s the kicker:</p>

  <p>Has a team of several devs to implement his vibe coded prototypes to sg workable</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’d love to hear more about this (and similar stories)</p>

<p> ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p><a href="https://checkeagle.com/checklists/njr/a-month-of-chat-oriented-programming/">Nick Radcliffe</a> writes about a month of using AI</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I spent a solid month “pair programming” with Claude Code, trying to suspend disbelief and adopt a this-will-be-productive mindset. More specifically, I got Claude to write well over 99% of the code produced during the month. I found the experience infuriating, unpleasant, and stressful before even worrying about its energy impact. Ideally, I would prefer not to do it again for at least a year or two. The only problem with that is that it “worked”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He stresses that his approach is the “polar opposite” of Vibe Coding. The post is long, and rambles a bit, but is worthwhile because he talks in detail about his workflow and how he uses the tool. Such posts are important so we can learn the nitty-gritty of how our programming habits are changing.</p>

<p> ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p>Along similar lines is a post of <a href="https://brianchambers.substack.com/p/chamber-of-tech-secrets-55-issue">Brian Chambers</a> on his workflow, that he calls Issue-Driven Development (and yes, I’m also sick of the “something-driven” phraseology). As with much of the better stuff I’ve heard about AI assisted work, it’s all about carefully managing the context window, ensuring the AI is focused on the right things and not distracted by textual squirrels.</p>

**摘要**: <p><img alt="radar image" src="https://martinfowler.com/articles/images/frags-2025-11/radar.png" width="300px" /></p>

<p>I’ve been on the road in Europe for the last couple of weeks, and while I was there Thoughtworks released <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar">volume 33 of our Technology Radar</a>. Again it’s dominated by the AI wave, with lots of blips capturing our explorations of how to use LLMs and similar technology. “Agents” are the big thing these days but we’re also seeing growing movements in infrastructure orchestration, coding workflows - and the inevitable antipatterns. Many thanks to my colleagues for putting this together again.</p>

<p>                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p><img alt="Gergely and I recording the podcast" src="https://martinfowler.com/articles/images/frags-2025-11/podcast.png" width="400px" /></p>

<p>My trip to Europe started in Amsterdam, for a Thoughtworks event for a few of our clients there. Since I was in that lovely city, I got in touch with Gergely Orosz, host of <a href="https://www.pragmaticengineer.com/">The Pragmatic Engineer</a>, and he arranged to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQmI4XKTa0U">record a podcast</a> with me. No surprise that AI was front-and-center of the conversation, as I said it was the biggest shift I’d seen in programming during my career, comparable only to the shift to high-level languages, which even I am not old enough to have experienced. It was a fun chat and I really enjoyed myself. Gergely later joined myself James Lewis and Giles Edwards-Alexander at the Thoughtworks event the next day.</p>

<p>                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p>My travels also took me to Nüremberg, where I attended an internal conference for Siemens on the future of software architecture. When we think of technology, it’s easy to focus on the Faangs of Silicon Valley, but Siemens have a huge workforce of software developers working on heavy engineering systems like trains and factory automation. It was good to hear them talk about federated architectures, data mesh, and their use of AI.</p>

<p>                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p><img alt="Kent's graph of options vs features" src="https://martinfowler.com/articles/images/frags-2025-11/features.webp" width="400px" /></p>

<p>I’ve often used pseudo-graphs to help explain why <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/is-quality-worth-cost.html">high quality software is cheaper</a>. This time, <a href="https://tidyfirst.substack.com/p/why-does-development-slow">Kent Beck</a> creates a unique perspective to this chart, dispensing with the temporal axis to help think in terms of optionality.</p>

<p>                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p><img alt="Heavy Cardboard banner" src="https://martinfowler.com/articles/images/frags-2025-11/hc.jpg" width="400px" /></p>

<p>And in another life, Edward has finally finished the great migration of the Heavy Cardboard studio and returns to the tubes with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/e8juRvm9h0c">our first game in the new digs</a>. (No surprise that it’s Age of Steam.)</p>

### [v0.14.0](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/releases/tag/v0.14.0)

**来源**: vLLM GitHub Releases

**摘要**: <h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>This release features approximately 660 commits from 251 contributors (86 new contributors).</p>
<p><strong>Breaking Changes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Async scheduling is now enabled by default</strong> - Users who experience issues can disable with <code>--no-async-scheduling</code>.
<ul>
<li>Excludes some not-yet-supported configurations: pipeline parallel, CPU backend, non-MTP/Eagle spec decoding.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>PyTorch 2.9.1</strong> is now required and the default wheel is compiled against cu129.</li>
<li>Deprecated quantization schemes have been removed (<a class="issue-link js-issue-link" href="https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/31688">#31688</a>, <a class="issue-link js-issue-link" href="https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/31285">#31285</a>).</li>
<li>When using speculative decoding, unsupported sampling parameters will fail rather than being silently ignored (<a class="issue-link js-issue-link" href="https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/31982">#31982</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Improvements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Async scheduling enabled by default</strong> (<a class="issue-link js-issue-link" href="https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/27614">#27614</a>): Overlaps engine core scheduling with GPU execution, improving throughput without user configuration. Now also works with speculative decoding (<a class="issue-link js-issue-link" href="https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/31998">#31998</a>) and structured outputs (<a class="issue-link js-issue-link" href="https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/29821">#29821</a>).</li>
<li><strong>gRPC server entrypoint</strong> (<a class="issue-link js-issue-link" href="https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/30190">#30190</a>): Alternative to REST API with binary protocol, HTTP/2 multiplexing.</li>
<li><strong><code>--max-model-len auto</code></strong> (<a class="issue-link js-issue-link" href="https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/29431">#29431</a>): Automatically fits context length to available GPU memory, eliminating OOM startup failures.</li>
<li><strong>Model inspection view</strong> (<a class="issue-link js-issue-link" href="https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/29450">#29450</a>): View the modules, attention backends, and quantization of your model in vLLM by specifying <code>VLLM_LOG_MODEL_INSPECTION=1</code> or by simply printing the <code>LLM</code> object.</li>
<li><strong>Model Runner V2 enhancements</strong>: UVA block tables (<a class="issue-link js-issue-link" href="https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/31965">#31965</a>), M-RoPE (<a class="issue-link js-issue-link" href="https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/32143">#32143</a>), <code>logit_bias</code>/<code>allowed_token_ids</code>/<code>min_tokens</code> support (<a class="issue-link js-issue-link" href="https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/32163">#32163</a>).
<ul>
<li>Please note that Model Runner V2 is still experimental and disabled by default.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

### [Kernel prepatch 6.19-rc7](https://lwn.net/Articles/1055796/)

**来源**: LWN.net (Linux Weekly News)

**摘要**: The <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1055839/">6.19-rc7</a> kernel prepatch is out for
testing.
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	So normally this would be the last rc of the release, but as I've
	mentioned every rc (because I really want people to be aware and be
	able to plan for things) this release we'll have an rc8 due to the
	holiday season.
<p>
	And while some of the early rc's were smaller than usual and it
	didn't seem necessary, right now I'm quite happy I made that
	call. Not because there's anything particularly scary here - the
	release seems to be going fairly smoothly - but because this rc7
	really is larger than things normally are and should be at this
	point.
</blockquote>
<p>
Along with the usual fixes, this -rc also includes <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/20260124012256.1856709-1-dan.j.williams@intel.com">a new
document</a> describing the process to replace the kernel project
leadership should that become necessary in the absence of an arranged
transition.  The plan largely follows what was decided at <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1050179/">the Maintainers Summit</a> in December.

### [A data model for Git (and other docs updates)](https://jvns.ca/blog/2026/01/08/a-data-model-for-git/)

**来源**: Julia Evans

**摘要**: <p>Hello! This past fall, I decided to take some time to work on Git&rsquo;s
documentation. I&rsquo;ve been thinking about working on open source docs for a long
time &ndash; usually if I think the documentation for something could be improved,
I&rsquo;ll write a blog post or a zine or something. But this time I wondered: could I
instead make a few improvements to the official documentation?</p>
<p>So <a href="https://marieflanagan.com/">Marie</a> and I made a few changes to the Git
documentation!</p>
<h3 id="a-data-model-for-git">a data model for Git</h3>
<p>After a while working on the documentation, we noticed that Git uses the terms
&ldquo;object&rdquo;, &ldquo;reference&rdquo;, or &ldquo;index&rdquo; in its documentation a lot, but that it didn&rsquo;t
have a great explanation of what those terms mean or how they relate to other
core concepts like &ldquo;commit&rdquo; and &ldquo;branch&rdquo;. So we wrote a new &ldquo;data model&rdquo; document!</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/gitdatamodel.adoc">read the data model here for now</a>.
I assume at some point (after the next release?) it&rsquo;ll also be on the <a href="https://git-scm.com">Git website</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited about this because understanding how Git organizes its commit and
branch data has really helped me reason about how Git works over the years,
and I think it&rsquo;s important to have a short (1600 words!) version of the data
model that&rsquo;s accurate.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;accurate&rdquo; part turned out to not be that easy: I knew the basics of how
Git&rsquo;s data model worked, but during the review process I learned some new
details and had to make quite a few changes (for example how merge conflicts are
stored in the staging area).</p>
<h3 id="updates-to-git-push-git-pull-and-more">updates to <code>git push</code>, <code>git pull</code>, and more</h3>
<p>I also worked on updating the introduction to some of Git&rsquo;s core man pages.
I quickly realized that &ldquo;just try to improve it according to my best judgement&rdquo;
was not going to work: why should the maintainers believe me that my version is
better?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen a problem a lot when discussing open source documentation changes
where 2 expert users of the software argue about whether an explanation
is clear or not (&ldquo;I think X would be a good way to explain it! Well, I think Y
would be better!&rdquo;)</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think this is very productive (expert users of a piece of software
are notoriously bad at being able to tell if an explanation will be clear to
non-experts), so I needed to find a way to identify problems with the man
pages that was a little more evidence-based.</p>
<h3 id="getting-test-readers-to-identify-problems">getting test readers to identify problems</h3>
<p>I asked for test readers on Mastodon to read the current version of
documentation and tell me what they find confusing or what questions they have.
About 80 test readers left comments, and I learned so much!</p>
<p>People left a huge amount of great feedback, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>terminology they didn&rsquo;t understand (what&rsquo;s a pathspec? what does &ldquo;reference&rdquo; mean? does &ldquo;upstream&rdquo; have a specific meaning in Git?)</li>
<li>specific confusing sentences</li>
<li>suggestions of things things to add (&ldquo;I do X all the time, I think it should be included here&rdquo;)</li>
<li>inconsistencies (&ldquo;here it implies X is the default, but elsewhere it implies Y is the default&rdquo;)</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the test readers had been using Git for at least 5-10 years, which
I think worked well &ndash; if a group of test readers who have been using Git
regularly for 5+ years find a sentence or term impossible to understand, it
makes it easy to argue that the documentation should be updated to make it
clearer.</p>
<p>I thought this &ldquo;get users of the software to comment on the existing
documentation and then fix the problems they find&rdquo; pattern worked really
well and I&rsquo;m excited about potentially trying it again in the future.</p>
<h3 id="the-man-page-changes">the man page changes</h3>
<p>We ended updating these 4 man pages:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>git add</code> (<a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/2b3ae040/Documentation/git-add.adoc">before</a>, <a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/e0bfec3dfc356f7d808eb5ee546a54116b794397/Documentation/git-add.adoc">after</a>)</li>
<li><code>git checkout</code> (<a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/2b3ae040/Documentation/git-checkout.adoc">before</a>, <a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/e0bfec3dfc356f7d808eb5ee546a54116b794397/Documentation/git-checkout.adoc">after</a>)</li>
<li><code>git push</code> (<a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/2b3ae040/Documentation/git-push.adoc">before</a>, <a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/e0bfec3dfc356f7d808eb5ee546a54116b794397/Documentation/git-push.adoc">after</a>)</li>
<li><code>git pull</code> (<a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/2b3ae040/Documentation/git-pull.adoc">before</a>, <a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/e0bfec3dfc356f7d808eb5ee546a54116b794397/Documentation/git-pull.adoc">after</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>git push</code> and <code>git pull</code> changes were the most interesting to me: in
addition to updating the intro to those pages, we also ended up writing:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/e0bfec3dfc356f7d808eb5ee546a54116b794397/Documentation/urls-remotes.adoc#upstream-branches">a section describing what the term &ldquo;upstream branch&rdquo; means</a> (which previously wasn&rsquo;t really explained)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/e0bfec3dfc356f7d808eb5ee546a54116b794397/Documentation/git-push.adoc#options">a cleaned-up description of what a &ldquo;push refspec&rdquo; is</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Making those changes really gave me an appreciation for how much work it is
to maintain open source documentation: it&rsquo;s not easy to write things that are
both clear and true, and sometimes we had to make compromises, for example the sentence
&ldquo;<code>git push</code> may fail if you haven’t set an upstream for the current branch,
depending on what <code>push.default</code> is set to.&rdquo; is a little vague, but the exact
details of what &ldquo;depending&rdquo; means are really complicated and untangling that is
a big project.</p>
<h3 id="on-the-process-for-contributing-to-git">on the process for contributing to Git</h3>
<p>It took me a while to understand Git&rsquo;s development process.
I&rsquo;m not going to try to describe it here (that could be a whole other post!), but a few quick notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Git has a <a href="https://git-scm.com/community#discord">Discord server</a>
with a &ldquo;my first contribution&rdquo; channel for help with getting started contributing.
I found people to be very welcoming on the Discord.</li>
<li>I used <a href="https://gitgitgadget.github.io/">GitGitGadget</a> to make all of my contributions.
This meant that I could make a GitHub pull request (a workflow I&rsquo;m comfortable
with) and GitGitGadget would convert my PRs into the system the Git developers
use (emails with patches attached). GitGitGadget worked great and I was very
grateful to not have to learn how to send patches by email with Git.</li>
<li>Otherwise I used my normal email client (Fastmail&rsquo;s web interface) to reply
to emails, wrapping my text to 80 character lines since that&rsquo;s the mailing
list norm.</li>
</ul>
<p>I also found the mailing list archives on <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/git/">lore.kernel.org</a>
hard to navigate, so I hacked together <a href="https://github.com/jvns/git-list-viewer">my own git list viewer</a>
to make it easier to read the long mailing list threads.</p>
<p>Many people helped me navigate the contribution process and review the changes:
thanks to Emily Shaffer, Johannes Schindelin (the author of GitGitGadget),
Patrick Steinhardt, Ben Knoble, Junio Hamano, and more.</p>
<p>(I&rsquo;m experimenting with <a href="https://comments.jvns.ca/post/115861337435768520">comments on Mastodon, you can see the comments here</a>)</p>

### [Notes on switching to Helix from vim](https://jvns.ca/blog/2025/10/10/notes-on-switching-to-helix-from-vim/)

**来源**: Julia Evans

**摘要**: <p>Hello! Earlier this summer I was talking to a friend about how much I
<a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2024/09/12/reasons-i--still--love-fish/">love using fish</a>, and
how I love that I don&rsquo;t have to configure it. They said that they feel the same
way about the <a href="https://helix-editor.com/">helix</a> text editor, and so I decided
to give it a try.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using it for 3 months now and here are a few notes.</p>
<h3 id="why-helix-language-servers">why helix: language servers</h3>
<p>I think what motivated me to try Helix is that I&rsquo;ve been trying to get a working
language server setup (so I can do things like &ldquo;go to definition&rdquo;) and getting
a setup that feels good in Vim or Neovim just felt like too much work.</p>
<p>After using Vim/Neovim for 20 years, I&rsquo;ve tried both &ldquo;build my own custom
configuration from scratch&rdquo; and &ldquo;use someone else&rsquo;s pre-buld configuration
system&rdquo; and even though I love Vim I was excited about having things just work
without having to work on my configuration at all.</p>
<p>Helix comes with built in language server support, and it feels nice
to be able to do things like &ldquo;rename this symbol&rdquo; in any language.</p>
<h3 id="the-search-is-great">the search is great</h3>
<p>One of my favourite things about Helix is the search! If I&rsquo;m searching all the
files in my repository for a string, it lets me scroll through the potential
matching files and see the full context of the match, like this:</p>
<img src="https://jvns.ca/images/helix-search.png" />
<p>For comparison, here&rsquo;s what the vim ripgrep plugin I&rsquo;ve been using looks like:</p>
<img src="https://jvns.ca/images/vim-ripgrep.png" />
<p>There&rsquo;s no context for what else is around that line.</p>
<h3 id="the-quick-reference-is-nice">the quick reference is nice</h3>
<p>One thing I like about Helix is that when I press <code>g</code>, I get a little help popup
telling me places I can go. I really appreciate this because I don&rsquo;t often use
the &ldquo;go to definition&rdquo; or &ldquo;go to reference&rdquo; feature and I often forget the
keyboard shortcut.</p>
<img src="https://jvns.ca/images/goto.png" width="300px" />
<h3 id="some-vim-helix-translations">some vim -&gt; helix translations</h3>
<ul>
<li>Helix doesn&rsquo;t have marks like <code>ma</code>, <code>'a</code>, instead I&rsquo;ve been using <code>Ctrl+O</code> and
<code>Ctrl+I</code> to go back (or forward) to the last cursor location</li>
<li>I think Helix does have macros, but I&rsquo;ve been using multiple cursors in every
case that I would have previously used a macro. I like multiple cursors a lot
more than writing macros all the time. If I want to batch change something in
the document, my workflow is to press <code>%</code> (to highlight everything), then <code>s</code>
to select (with a regex) the things I want to change, then I can just edit
all of them as needed.</li>
<li>Helix doesn&rsquo;t have neovim-style tabs, instead it has a nice buffer switcher (<code>&lt;space&gt;b</code>)
I can use to switch to the buffer I want. There&rsquo;s a
<a href="https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/pull/7109">pull request here</a> to implement neovim-style tabs.
There&rsquo;s also a setting <code>bufferline=&quot;multiple&quot;</code> which can act a bit like tabs
with <code>gp</code>, <code>gn</code> for prev/next &ldquo;tab&rdquo; and <code>:bc</code> to close a &ldquo;tab&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="some-helix-annoyances">some helix annoyances</h3>
<p>Here&rsquo;s everything that&rsquo;s annoyed me about Helix so far.</p>
<ul>
<li>I like the way Helix&rsquo;s <code>:reflow</code> works much less than how
vim reflows text with <code>gq</code>. It doesn&rsquo;t work as well with lists. (<a href="https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/issues/3332">github issue</a>)</li>
<li>If I&rsquo;m making a Markdown list, pressing &ldquo;enter&rdquo; at the end of a list item
won&rsquo;t continue the list. There&rsquo;s a <a href="https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/wiki/Recipes#continue-markdown-lists--quotes">partial workaround</a>
for bulleted lists but I don&rsquo;t know one for numbered lists.</li>
<li>No persistent undo yet: in vim I could use an
<a href="https://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/options.html#'undofile'">undofile</a> so
that I could undo changes even after quitting. Helix doesn&rsquo;t have that feature yet.
(<a href="https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/pull/9154">github PR</a>)</li>
<li>Helix doesn&rsquo;t autoreload files after they change on disk, I have to run
<code>:reload-all</code> (<code>:ra&lt;tab&gt;</code>) to manually reload them. Not a big deal.</li>
<li>Sometimes it crashes, maybe every week or so. I think it might be
<a href="https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/issues/12582">this issue</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The &ldquo;markdown list&rdquo; and reflowing issues come up a lot for me because I spend
a lot of time editing Markdown lists, but I keep using Helix anyway so I guess
they can&rsquo;t be making me that mad.</p>
<h3 id="switching-was-easier-than-i-thought">switching was easier than I thought</h3>
<p>I was worried that relearning 20 years of Vim muscle memory would be really hard.</p>
<p>It turned out to be easier than I expected, I started using Helix on a
vacation for a little low-stakes coding project I was doing on the side and
after a week or two it didn&rsquo;t feel so disorienting anymore. I think it might be
hard to switch back and forth between Vim and Helix, but I haven&rsquo;t needed to use
Vim recently so I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;ll ever become an issue for me.</p>
<p>The first time I tried Helix I tried to force it to use keybindings that were
more similar to Vim and that did not work for me. Just learning the &ldquo;Helix way&rdquo;
was a lot easier.</p>
<p>There are still some things that throw me off: for example <code>w</code> in vim and <code>w</code> in
Helix don&rsquo;t have the same idea of what a &ldquo;word&rdquo; is (the Helix one includes the
space after the word, the Vim one doesn&rsquo;t).</p>
<h3 id="using-a-terminal-based-text-editor">using a terminal-based text editor</h3>
<p>For many years I&rsquo;d mostly been using a GUI version of vim/neovim, so switching
to actually using an editor in the terminal was a bit of an adjustment.</p>
<p>I ended up deciding on:</p>
<ol>
<li>Every project gets its own terminal window, and all of the tabs in that
window (mostly) have the same working directory</li>
<li>I make my Helix tab the first tab in the terminal window</li>
</ol>
<p>It works pretty well, I might actually like it better than my previous workflow.</p>
<h3 id="my-configuration">my configuration</h3>
<p>I appreciate that my configuration is really simple, compared to my neovim
configuration which is hundreds of lines. It&rsquo;s mostly just 4 keyboard
shortcuts.</p>
<pre><code>theme = &quot;solarized_light&quot;
[editor]
# Sync clipboard with system clipboard
default-yank-register = &quot;+&quot;

[keys.normal]
# I didn't like that Ctrl+C was the default &quot;toggle comments&quot; shortcut
&quot;#&quot; = &quot;toggle_comments&quot;

# I didn't feel like learning a different way
# to go to the beginning/end of a line so
# I remapped ^ and $
&quot;^&quot; = &quot;goto_first_nonwhitespace&quot;
&quot;$&quot; = &quot;goto_line_end&quot;

[keys.select]
&quot;^&quot; = &quot;goto_first_nonwhitespace&quot;
&quot;$&quot; = &quot;goto_line_end&quot;

[keys.normal.space]
# I write a lot of text so I need to constantly reflow,
# and missed vim's `gq` shortcut
l = &quot;:reflow&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>There&rsquo;s a separate <code>languages.toml</code> configuration where I set some language
preferences, like turning off autoformatting.
For example, here&rsquo;s my Python configuration:</p>
<pre><code>[[language]]
name = &quot;python&quot;
formatter = { command = &quot;black&quot;, args = [&quot;--stdin-filename&quot;, &quot;%{buffer_name}&quot;, &quot;-&quot;] }
language-servers = [&quot;pyright&quot;]
auto-format = false
</code></pre>
<h3 id="we-ll-see-how-it-goes">we&rsquo;ll see how it goes</h3>
<p>Three months is not that long, and it&rsquo;s possible that I&rsquo;ll decide to go back
to Vim at some point. For example, I wrote a <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/02/28/some-notes-on-using-nix/">post about switching to
nix</a> a while back but
after maybe 8 months I switched back to Homebrew (though I&rsquo;m still using NixOS

### [New zine: The Secret Rules of the Terminal](https://jvns.ca/blog/2025/06/24/new-zine--the-secret-rules-of-the-terminal/)

**摘要**: <p>Hello! After many months of writing deep dive blog posts about the terminal, on
Tuesday I released a new zine called &ldquo;The Secret Rules of the Terminal&rdquo;!</p>
<p>You can get it for $12 here:

an <a href="https://wizardzines.com/zines/all-the-zines/">15-pack of all my zines here</a>.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the cover:</p>

<h3 id="why-the-terminal">why the terminal?</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using the terminal every day for 20 years but even though I&rsquo;m very
confident in the terminal, I&rsquo;ve always had a bit of an uneasy feeling about it.
Usually things work fine, but sometimes something goes wrong and it just feels
like investigating it is impossible, or at least like it would open up a huge
can of worms.</p>
<p>So I started trying to write down a list of weird problems I&rsquo;ve run into in terminal and I realized
that the terminal has a lot of tiny inconsistencies like:</p>
<ul>
<li>sometimes you can use the arrow keys to move around, but sometimes pressing the arrow keys just prints <code>^[[D</code></li>
<li>sometimes you can use the mouse to select text, but sometimes you can&rsquo;t</li>
<li>sometimes your commands get saved to a history when you run them, and sometimes they don&rsquo;t</li>
<li>some shells let you use the up arrow to see the previous command, and some don&rsquo;t</li>
</ul>
<p>If you use the terminal daily for 10 or 20 years, even if you don&rsquo;t understand
exactly <em>why</em> these things happen, you&rsquo;ll probably build an intuition for them.</p>
<p>But having an intuition for them isn&rsquo;t the same as understanding why they
happen. When writing this zine I actually had to do a lot of work to figure out
exactly what was <em>happening</em> in the terminal to be able to talk about how to
reason about it.</p>
<h3 id="the-rules-aren-t-written-down-anywhere">the rules aren&rsquo;t written down anywhere</h3>
<p>It turns out that the &ldquo;rules&rdquo; for how the terminal works (how do
you edit a command you type in? how do you quit a program? how do you fix your
colours?) are extremely hard to fully understand, because &ldquo;the terminal&rdquo; is actually
made of many different pieces of software (your terminal emulator, your
operating system, your shell, the core utilities like <code>grep</code>, and every other random
terminal program you&rsquo;ve installed) which are written by different people with different
ideas about how things should work.</p>
<p>So I wanted to write something that would explain:</p>
<ul>
<li>how the 4 pieces of the terminal (your shell, terminal emulator, programs, and TTY driver) fit together to make everything work</li>
<li>some of the core conventions for how you can expect things in your terminal to work</li>
<li>lots of tips and tricks for how to use terminal programs</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="this-zine-explains-the-most-useful-parts-of-terminal-internals">this zine explains the most useful parts of terminal internals</h3>
<p>Terminal internals are a mess. A lot of it is just the way it is because
someone made a decision in the 80s and now it&rsquo;s impossible to change, and
honestly I don&rsquo;t think learning everything about terminal internals is worth
it.</p>
<p>But some parts are not that hard to understand and can really make your
experience in the terminal better, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you understand what <strong>your shell</strong> is responsible for, you can configure your shell (or use a different one!) to access your history more easily, get great tab completion, and so much more</li>
<li>if you understand <strong>escape codes</strong>, it&rsquo;s much less scary when <code>cat</code>ing a binary to stdout messes up your terminal, you can just type <code>reset</code> and move on</li>
<li>if you understand how <strong>colour</strong> works, you can get rid of bad colour contrast in your terminal so you can actually read the text</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="i-learned-a-surprising-amount-writing-this-zine">I learned a surprising amount writing this zine</h3>
<p>When I wrote <a href="https://wizardzines.com/zines/git">How Git Works</a>, I thought I
knew how Git worked, and I was right. But the terminal is different. Even
though I feel totally confident in the terminal and even though I&rsquo;ve used it
every day for 20 years, I had a lot of misunderstandings about how the terminal
works and (unless you&rsquo;re the author of <code>tmux</code> or something) I think there&rsquo;s a
good chance you do too.</p>
<p>A few things I learned that are actually useful to me:</p>
<ul>
<li>I understand the structure of the terminal better and so I feel more
confident debugging weird terminal stuff that happens to me (I was even able
to suggest a <a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10834">small improvement</a> to fish!). Identifying exactly which piece of software is causing a weird thing to happen in my terminal still isn&rsquo;t <em>easy</em> but I&rsquo;m a lot better at it now.</li>
<li>you can write a shell script to <a href="https://jvns.ca/til/vim-osc52/">copy to your clipboard over SSH</a></li>
<li>how <code>reset</code> works under the hood (it does the equivalent of <code>stty sane; sleep 1; tput reset</code>) – basically I learned that I don&rsquo;t ever need to worry about
remembering <code>stty sane</code> or <code>tput reset</code> and I can just run <code>reset</code> instead</li>
<li>how to look at the invisible escape codes that a program is printing out (run <code>unbuffer program &gt; out; less out</code>)</li>
<li>why the builtin REPLs on my Mac like <code>sqlite3</code> are so annoying to use (they use <code>libedit</code> instead of <code>readline</code>)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="blog-posts-i-wrote-along-the-way">blog posts I wrote along the way</h3>
<p>As usual these days I wrote a bunch of blog posts about various side quests:</p>

people I know who actually understands the terminal&rsquo;s cursed inner workings)
had so many incredibly helpful conversations with me about what is going on in
the terminal.</p>

### [Using `make` to compile C programs (for non-C-programmers)](https://jvns.ca/blog/2025/06/10/how-to-compile-a-c-program/)

**来源**: Julia Evans

**摘要**: <p>I have never been a C programmer but every so often I need to compile a C/C++
program from source. This has been kind of a struggle for me: for a
long time, my approach was basically &ldquo;install the dependencies, run <code>make</code>, if
it doesn&rsquo;t work, either try to find a binary someone has compiled or give up&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope someone else has compiled it&rdquo; worked pretty well when I was running Linux
but since I&rsquo;ve been using a Mac for the last couple of years I&rsquo;ve been running
into more situations where I have to actually compile programs myself.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about what you might have to do to compile a C program! I&rsquo;ll use
a couple of examples of specific C programs I&rsquo;ve compiled and talk about a few
things that can go wrong. Here are three programs we&rsquo;ll be talking about
compiling:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://mj.ucw.cz/sw/paperjam/">paperjam</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.sqlite.org/download.html">sqlite</a></li>
<li><a href="https://git.causal.agency/src/tree/bin/qf.c">qf</a> (a pager you can run to quickly open files from a search with <code>rg -n THING | qf</code>)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-1-install-a-c-compiler">step 1: install a C compiler</h3>
<p>This is pretty simple: on an Ubuntu system if I don&rsquo;t already have a C compiler I&rsquo;ll install one with:</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt-get install build-essential
</code></pre>
<p>This installs <code>gcc</code>, <code>g++</code>, and <code>make</code>. The situation on a Mac is more
confusing but it&rsquo;s something like &ldquo;install xcode command line tools&rdquo;.</p>
<h3 id="step-2-install-the-program-s-dependencies">step 2: install the program&rsquo;s dependencies</h3>
<p>Unlike some newer programming languages, C doesn&rsquo;t have a dependency manager.
So if a program has any dependencies, you need to hunt them down yourself.
Thankfully because of this, C programmers usually keep their dependencies very
minimal and often the dependencies will be available in whatever package manager you&rsquo;re using.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s almost always a section explaining how to get the dependencies in the
README, for example in <a href="https://mj.ucw.cz/sw/paperjam/">paperjam</a>&rsquo;s README, it
says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To compile PaperJam, you need the headers for the libqpdf and libpaper libraries (usually available as libqpdf-dev and libpaper-dev packages).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You may need <code>a2x</code> (found in <a href="http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/a2x.1.html">AsciiDoc</a>) for building manual pages.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So on a Debian-based system you can install the dependencies like this.</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt install -y libqpdf-dev libpaper-dev
</code></pre>
<p>If a README gives a name for a package (like <code>libqpdf-dev</code>), I&rsquo;d basically
always assume that they mean &ldquo;in a Debian-based Linux distro&rdquo;: if you&rsquo;re on a
Mac <code>brew install libqpdf-dev</code> will not work. I still have not 100% gotten
the hang of developing on a Mac yet so I don&rsquo;t have many tips there yet. I
guess in this case it would be <code>brew install qpdf</code> if you&rsquo;re using Homebrew.</p>
<h3 id="step-3-run-configure-if-needed">step 3: run <code>./configure</code> (if needed)</h3>
<p>Some C programs come with a <code>Makefile</code> and some instead come with a script called
<code>./configure</code>. For example, if you download <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/download.html">sqlite&rsquo;s source code</a>, it has a <code>./configure</code> script in
it instead of a Makefile.</p>
<p>My understanding of this <code>./configure</code> script is:</p>
<ol>
<li>You run it, it prints out a lot of somewhat inscrutable output, and then it
either generates a <code>Makefile</code> or fails because you&rsquo;re missing some
dependency</li>
<li>The <code>./configure</code> script is part of a system called
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/Autotools-Introduction.html">autotools</a>
that I have never needed to learn anything about beyond &ldquo;run it to generate
a <code>Makefile</code>&rdquo;.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think there might be some options you can pass to get the <code>./configure</code>
script to produce a different <code>Makefile</code> but I have never done that.</p>
<h3 id="step-4-run-make">step 4: run <code>make</code></h3>
<p>The next step is to run <code>make</code> to try to build a program. Some notes about
<code>make</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes you can run <code>make -j8</code> to parallelize the build and make it go
faster</li>
<li>It usually prints out a million compiler warnings when compiling the program.
I always just ignore them. I didn&rsquo;t write the software! The compiler warnings
are not my problem.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="compiler-errors-are-often-dependency-problems">compiler errors are often dependency problems</h3>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an error I got while compiling <code>paperjam</code> on my Mac:</p>
<pre><code>/opt/homebrew/Cellar/qpdf/12.0.0/include/qpdf/InputSource.hh:85:19: error: function definition does not declare parameters
   85 |     qpdf_offset_t last_offset{0};
      |                   ^
</code></pre>
<p>Over the years I&rsquo;ve learned it&rsquo;s usually best not to overthink problems like
this: if it&rsquo;s talking about <code>qpdf</code>, there&rsquo;s a good change it just means that
I&rsquo;ve done something wrong with how I&rsquo;m including the <code>qpdf</code> dependency.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s talk about some ways to get the <code>qpdf</code> dependency included in the right way.</p>
<h3 id="the-world-s-shortest-introduction-to-the-compiler-and-linker">the world&rsquo;s shortest introduction to the compiler and linker</h3>
<p>Before we talk about how to fix dependency problems: building C programs is split into 2
steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Compiling</strong> the code into <strong>object files</strong> (with <code>gcc</code> or <code>clang</code>)</li>
<li><strong>Linking</strong> those object files into a final binary (with <code>ld</code>)</li>
</ol>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to know this when building a C program because sometimes you
need to pass the right flags to the compiler and linker to tell them where to
find the dependencies for the program you&rsquo;re compiling.</p>
<h3 id="make-uses-environment-variables-to-configure-the-compiler-and-linker"><code>make</code> uses environment variables to configure the compiler and linker</h3>
<p>If I run <code>make</code> on my Mac to install <code>paperjam</code>, I get this error:</p>
<pre><code>c++ -o paperjam paperjam.o pdf-tools.o parse.o cmds.o pdf.o -lqpdf -lpaper
ld: library 'qpdf' not found
</code></pre>
<p>This is not because <code>qpdf</code> is not installed on my system (it actually is!). But
the compiler and linker don&rsquo;t know how to <em>find</em> the <code>qpdf</code> library. To fix this, we need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>pass <code>&quot;-I/opt/homebrew/include&quot;</code> to the compiler (to tell it where to find the header files)</li>
<li>pass <code>&quot;-L/opt/homebrew/lib -liconv&quot;</code> to the linker (to tell it where to find library files and to link in <code>iconv</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>And we can get <code>make</code> to pass those extra parameters to the compiler and linker using environment variables!
To see how this works: inside <code>paperjam</code>&rsquo;s Makefile you can see a bunch of environment variables, like <code>LDLIBS</code> here:</p>
<pre><code>paperjam: $(OBJS)
	$(LD) -o $@ $^ $(LDLIBS)
</code></pre>
<p>Everything you put into the <code>LDLIBS</code> environment variable gets passed to the
linker (<code>ld</code>) as a command line argument.</p>
<h3 id="secret-environment-variable-cppflags">secret environment variable: <code>CPPFLAGS</code></h3>
<p><code>Makefiles</code> sometimes define their own environment variables that they pass to
the compiler/linker, but <code>make</code> also has a bunch of &ldquo;implicit&rdquo; environment
variables which it will automatically pass to the C compiler and linker. There&rsquo;s a <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Implicit-Variables.html#index-CFLAGS0">full list of implicit environment variables here</a>,
but one of them is <code>CPPFLAGS</code>, which gets automatically passed to the C compiler.</p>
<p>(technically it would be more normal to use <code>CXXFLAGS</code> for this, but this
particular <code>Makefile</code> hardcodes <code>CXXFLAGS</code> so setting <code>CPPFLAGS</code> was the only
way I could find to set the compiler flags without editing the <code>Makefile</code>)</p>
<small>
As an aside: it took me a long time to realize how closely tied to C/C++ `make` is -- I used
to think that `make` was just a general build system (and of course you can use it for
anything!) but it has a lot of affordances for building C/C++ programs that it
doesn't have for building any other kind of program.
</small>
<h3 id="two-ways-to-pass-environment-variables-to-make">two ways to pass environment variables to <code>make</code></h3>
<p>I learned thanks to <a href="https://www.owlfolio.org/">@zwol</a> that there are actually two ways to pass environment variables to <code>make</code>:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>CXXFLAGS=xyz make</code> (the usual way)</li>
<li><code>make CXXFLAGS=xyz</code></li>
</ol>
<p>The difference between them is that <code>make CXXFLAGS=xyz</code> will override the
value of <code>CXXFLAGS</code> set in the <code>Makefile</code> but <code>CXXFLAGS=xyz make</code> won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure which way is the norm but I&rsquo;m going to use the first way in this
post.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-use-cppflags-and-ldlibs-to-fix-this-compiler-error">how to use <code>CPPFLAGS</code> and <code>LDLIBS</code> to fix this compiler error</h3>
<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve talked about how <code>CPPFLAGS</code> and <code>LDLIBS</code> get passed to the
compiler and linker, here&rsquo;s the final incantation that I used to get the
program to build successfully!</p>
<pre><code>CPPFLAGS=&quot;-I/opt/homebrew/include&quot; LDLIBS=&quot;-L/opt/homebrew/lib -liconv&quot; make paperjam
</code></pre>
<p>This passes <code>-I/opt/homebrew/include</code> to the compiler and <code>-L/opt/homebrew/lib -liconv</code> to the linker.</p>
<p>Also I don&rsquo;t want to pretend that I &ldquo;magically&rdquo; knew that those were the right
arguments to pass, figuring them out involved a bunch of confused Googling that I
skipped over in this post. I will say that:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <code>-I</code> compiler flag tells the compiler which directory to find header files in, like <code>/opt/homebrew/include/qpdf/QPDF.hh</code></li>
<li>the <code>-L</code> linker flag tells the linker which directory to find libraries in, like <code>/opt/homebrew/lib/libqpdf.a</code></li>
<li>the <code>-l</code> linker flag tells the linker which libraries to link in, like <code>-liconv</code> means &ldquo;link in the <code>iconv</code> library&rdquo;, or <code>-lm</code> means &ldquo;link <code>math</code>&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="tip-how-to-just-build-1-specific-file-make-filename">tip: how to just build 1 specific file: <code>make $FILENAME</code></h3>
<p>Yesterday I discovered this cool tool called
<a href="https://git.causal.agency/src/tree/bin/qf.c">qf</a> which you can use to quickly
open files from the output of <code>ripgrep</code>.</p>
<p><code>qf</code> is in a big directory of various tools, but I only wanted to compile <code>qf</code>.
So I just compiled <code>qf</code>, like this:</p>
<pre><code>make qf
</code></pre>
<p>Basically if you know (or can guess) the output filename of the file you&rsquo;re
trying to build, you can tell <code>make</code> to just build that file by running <code>make $FILENAME</code></p>
<h3 id="tip-you-don-t-need-a-makefile">tip: you don&rsquo;t need a Makefile</h3>
<p>I sometimes write 5-line C programs with no dependencies, and I just learned
that if I have a file called <code>blah.c</code>, I can just compile it like this without creating a <code>Makefile</code>:</p>
<pre><code>make blah
</code></pre>
<p>It gets automaticaly expanded to <code>cc -o blah blah.c</code>, which saves a bit of
typing. I have no idea if I&rsquo;m going to remember this (I might just keep typing
<code>gcc -o blah blah.c</code> anyway) but it seems like a fun trick.</p>
<h3 id="tip-look-at-how-other-packaging-systems-built-the-same-c-program">tip: look at how other packaging systems built the same C program</h3>
<p>If you&rsquo;re having trouble building a C program, maybe other people had problems building it
too! Every Linux distribution has build files for every package that they
build, so even if you can&rsquo;t install packages from that distribution directly,
maybe you can get tips from that Linux distro for how to build the package.
Realizing this (thanks to my friend Dave) was a huge ah-ha moment for me.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/405624e81a9b65378328accb0a11c3e5369e651c/pkgs/by-name/pa/paperjam/package.nix#L35">this line from the nix package for <code>paperjam</code></a> says:</p>
<pre><code>  env.NIX_LDFLAGS = lib.optionalString stdenv.hostPlatform.isDarwin &quot;-liconv&quot;;
</code></pre>
<p>This is basically saying &ldquo;pass the linker flag <code>-liconv</code> to build this on a
Mac&rdquo;, so that&rsquo;s a clue we could use to build it.</p>
<p>That same file also says <code>  env.NIX_CFLAGS_COMPILE = &quot;-DPOINTERHOLDER_TRANSITION=1&quot;;</code>. I&rsquo;m not sure what this means, but when I try
to build the <code>paperjam</code> package I do get an error about something called a
<code>PointerHolder</code>, so I guess that&rsquo;s somehow related to the &ldquo;PointerHolder
transition&rdquo;.</p>
<h3 id="step-5-installing-the-binary">step 5: installing the binary</h3>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve managed to compile the program, probably you want to install it somewhere!
Some <code>Makefile</code>s have an <code>install</code> target that let you install the tool on your
system with <code>make install</code>. I&rsquo;m always a bit scared of this (where is it going
to put the files? what if I want to uninstall them later?), so if I&rsquo;m compiling
a pretty simple program I&rsquo;ll often just manually copy the binary to install it
instead, like this:</p>
<pre><code>cp qf ~/bin
</code></pre>
<h3 id="step-6-maybe-make-your-own-package">step 6: maybe make your own package!</h3>
<p>Once I figured out how to do all of this, I realized that I could use my new
<code>make</code> knowledge to contribute a <code>paperjam</code> package to Homebrew! Then I could
just <code>brew install paperjam</code> on future systems.</p>
<p>The good thing is that even if the details of how all of the different
packaging systems, they fundamentally all use C compilers and linkers.</p>
<h3 id="it-can-be-useful-to-understand-a-little-about-c-even-if-you-re-not-a-c-programmer">it can be useful to understand a little about C even if you&rsquo;re not a C programmer</h3>
<p>I think all of this is an interesting example of how it can useful to
understand some basics of how C programs work (like &ldquo;they have header files&rdquo;)
even if you&rsquo;re never planning to write a nontrivial C program if your life.</p>
<p>It feels good to have some ability to compile C/C++ programs myself, even
though I&rsquo;m still not totally confident about all of the compiler and linker
flags and I still plan to never learn anything about how autotools works other
than &ldquo;you run <code>./configure</code> to generate the <code>Makefile</code>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Two things I left out of this post:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH / DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> (which you use to tell the dynamic
linker at runtime where to find dynamically linked files) because I can&rsquo;t
remember the last time I ran into an <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> issue and couldn&rsquo;t
find an example.</li>
<li><code>pkg-config</code>, which I think is important but I don&rsquo;t understand yet</li>
</ul>

### [Standards for ANSI escape codes](https://jvns.ca/blog/2025/03/07/escape-code-standards/)

**来源**: Julia Evans

**摘要**: <p>Hello! Today I want to talk about ANSI escape codes.</p>
<p>For a long time I was vaguely aware of ANSI escape codes (&ldquo;that&rsquo;s how you make
text red in the terminal and stuff&rdquo;) but I had no real understanding of where they were
supposed to be defined or whether or not there were standards for them. I just
had a kind of vague &ldquo;there be dragons&rdquo; feeling around them. While learning
about the terminal this year, I&rsquo;ve learned that:</p>
<ol>
<li>ANSI escape codes are responsible for a lot of usability improvements
in the terminal (did you know there&rsquo;s a way to copy to your system clipboard
when SSHed into a remote machine?? It&rsquo;s an escape code called <a href="https://jvns.ca/til/vim-osc52/">OSC 52</a>!)</li>
<li>They aren&rsquo;t completely standardized, and because of that they don&rsquo;t always
work reliably. And because they&rsquo;re also invisible, it&rsquo;s extremely
frustrating to troubleshoot escape code issues.</li>
</ol>
<p>So I wanted to put together a list for myself of some standards that exist
around escape codes, because I want to know if they <em>have</em> to feel unreliable
and frustrating, or if there&rsquo;s a future where we could all rely on them with
more confidence.</p>

<h3 id="what-s-an-escape-code">what&rsquo;s an escape code?</h3>
<p>Have you ever pressed the left arrow key in your terminal and seen <code>^[[D</code>?
That&rsquo;s an escape code! It&rsquo;s called an &ldquo;escape code&rdquo; because the first character
is the &ldquo;escape&rdquo; character, which is usually written as <code>ESC</code>, <code>\x1b</code>, <code>\E</code>,
<code>\033</code>, or <code>^[</code>.</p>
<p>Escape codes are how your terminal emulator communicates various kinds of
information (colours, mouse movement, etc) with programs running in the
terminal. There are two kind of escape codes:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>input codes</strong> which your terminal emulator sends for keypresses or mouse
movements that don&rsquo;t fit into Unicode. For example &ldquo;left arrow key&rdquo; is
<code>ESC[D</code>, &ldquo;Ctrl+left arrow&rdquo; might be <code>ESC[1;5D</code>, and clicking the mouse might
be something like <code>ESC[M :3</code>.</li>
<li><strong>output codes</strong> which programs can print out to colour text, move the
cursor around, clear the screen, hide the cursor, copy text to the
clipboard, enable mouse reporting, set the window title, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s talk about standards!</p>
<h3 id="ecma-48">ECMA-48</h3>
<p>The first standard I found relating to escape codes was
<a href="https://ecma-international.org/wp-content/uploads/ECMA-48_5th_edition_june_1991.pdf">ECMA-48</a>,
which was originally published in 1976.</p>
<p>ECMA-48 does two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Define some general <em>formats</em> for escape codes (like &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; codes, which are
<code>ESC[</code> + something and &ldquo;OSC&rdquo; codes, which are <code>ESC]</code> + something)</li>
<li>Define some specific escape codes, like how &ldquo;move the cursor to the left&rdquo; is
<code>ESC[D</code>, or &ldquo;turn text red&rdquo; is  <code>ESC[31m</code>. In the spec, the &ldquo;cursor left&rdquo;
one is called <code>CURSOR LEFT</code> and the one for changing colours is called
<code>SELECT GRAPHIC RENDITION</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The formats are extensible, so there&rsquo;s room for others to define more escape
codes in the future. Lots of escape codes that are popular today aren&rsquo;t defined
in ECMA-48: for example it&rsquo;s pretty common for terminal applications (like vim,
htop, or tmux) to support using the mouse, but ECMA-48 doesn&rsquo;t define escape
codes for the mouse.</p>
<h3 id="xterm-control-sequences">xterm control sequences</h3>
<p>There are a bunch of escape codes that aren&rsquo;t defined in ECMA-48, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>enabling mouse reporting (where did you click in your terminal?)</li>
<li>bracketed paste (did you paste that text or type it in?)</li>
<li>OSC 52 (which terminal applications can use to copy text to your system clipboard)</li>
</ul>
<p>I believe (correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong!) that these and some others came from
xterm, are documented in <a href="https://invisible-island.net/xterm/ctlseqs/ctlseqs.html">XTerm Control Sequences</a>, and have
been widely implemented by other terminal emulators.</p>
<p>This list of &ldquo;what xterm supports&rdquo; is not a standard exactly, but xterm is
extremely influential and so it seems like an important document.</p>
<h3 id="terminfo">terminfo</h3>
<p>In the 80s (and to some extent today, but my understanding is that it was MUCH
more dramatic in the 80s) there was a huge amount of variation in what escape
codes terminals actually supported.</p>
<p>To deal with this, there&rsquo;s a database of escape codes for various terminals
called &ldquo;terminfo&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It looks like the standard for terminfo is called <a href="https://publications.opengroup.org/c243-1">X/Open Curses</a>, though you need to create
an account to view that standard for some reason. It defines the database format as well
as a C library interface (&ldquo;curses&rdquo;) for accessing the database.</p>
<p>For example you can run this bash snippet to see every possible escape code for
&ldquo;clear screen&rdquo; for all of the different terminals your system knows about:</p>
<pre><code>for term in $(toe -a | awk '{print $1}')
do
  echo $term
  infocmp -1 -T &quot;$term&quot; 2&gt;/dev/null | grep 'clear=' | sed 's/clear=//g;s/,//g'
done
</code></pre>
<p>On my system (and probably every system I&rsquo;ve ever used?), the terminfo database is managed by ncurses.</p>
<h3 id="should-programs-use-terminfo">should programs use terminfo?</h3>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s interesting that there are two main approaches that applications
take to handling ANSI escape codes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use the terminfo database to figure out which escape codes to use, depending
on what&rsquo;s in the <code>TERM</code> environment variable. Fish does this, for example.</li>
<li>Identify a &ldquo;single common set&rdquo; of escape codes which works in &ldquo;enough&rdquo;
terminal emulators and just hardcode those.</li>
</ol>
<p>Some examples of programs/libraries that take approach #2 (&ldquo;don&rsquo;t use terminfo&rdquo;) include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/commit/c12699d2e9c2806d6ed184032078d0b84a3370bb">kakoune</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit/blob/165258d2f3ae594b50f16c7b50ffb06627476269/src/prompt_toolkit/input/ansi_escape_sequences.py#L5-L8">python-prompt-toolkit</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/antirez/linenoise">linenoise</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rockorager/libvaxis">libvaxis</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/chalk/chalk">chalk</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I got curious about why folks might be moving away from terminfo and I found
this very interesting and extremely detailed
<a href="https://twoot.site/@bean/113056942625234032">rant about terminfo from one of the fish maintainers</a>, which argues that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[the terminfo authors] have done a lot of work that, at the time, was
extremely important and helpful. My point is that it no longer is.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to do it justice so I&rsquo;m not going to summarize it, I think it&rsquo;s
worth reading.</p>
<h3 id="is-there-a-single-common-set-of-escape-codes">is there a &ldquo;single common set&rdquo; of escape codes?</h3>
<p>I was just talking about the idea that you can use a &ldquo;common set&rdquo; of escape
codes that will work for most people. But what is that set? Is there any agreement?</p>
<p>I really do not know the answer to this at all, but from doing some reading it
seems like it&rsquo;s some combination of:</p>
<ul>
<li>The codes that the VT100 supported (though some aren&rsquo;t relevant on modern terminals)</li>
<li>what&rsquo;s in ECMA-48 (which I think also has some things that are no longer relevant)</li>
<li>What xterm supports (though I&rsquo;d guess that not everything in there is actually widely supported enough)</li>
</ul>
<p>and maybe ultimately &ldquo;identify the terminal emulators you think your users are
going to use most frequently and test in those&rdquo;, the same way web developers do
when deciding which CSS features are okay to use</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there are any resources like <a href="https://caniuse.com/">Can I use&hellip;?</a> or
<a href="https://web-platform-dx.github.io/web-features/">Baseline</a> for the terminal
though. (in theory terminfo is supposed to be the &ldquo;caniuse&rdquo; for the terminal
but it seems like it often takes 10+ years to add new terminal features when
people invent them which makes it very limited)</p>
<h3 id="some-reasons-to-use-terminfo">some reasons to use terminfo</h3>
<p>I also asked on Mastodon why people found terminfo valuable in 2025 and got a
few reasons that made sense to me:</p>
<ul>
<li>some people expect to be able to use the <code>TERM</code> environment variable to
control how programs behave (for example with <code>TERM=dumb</code>), and there&rsquo;s
no standard for how that should work in a post-terminfo world</li>
<li>even though there&rsquo;s <em>less</em> variation between terminal emulators than
there was in the 80s, there&rsquo;s far from zero variation: there are graphical
terminals, the Linux framebuffer console, the situation you&rsquo;re in when
connecting to a server via its serial console, Emacs shell mode, and probably
more that I&rsquo;m missing</li>
<li>there is no one standard for what the &ldquo;single common set&rdquo; of escape codes
is, and sometimes programs use escape codes which aren&rsquo;t actually widely
supported enough</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="terminfo-user-agent-detection">terminfo &amp; user agent detection</h3>
<p>The way that ncurses uses the <code>TERM</code> environment variable to decide which
escape codes to use reminds me of how webservers used to sometimes use the
browser user agent to decide which version of a website to serve.</p>
<p>It also seems like it&rsquo;s had some of the same results &ndash; the way iTerm2 reports
itself as being &ldquo;xterm-256color&rdquo; feels similar to how Safari&rsquo;s user agent is
&ldquo;Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 14_7_4) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML,
like Gecko) Version/18.3 Safari/605.1.15&rdquo;. In both cases the terminal emulator
/ browser ends up changing its user agent to get around user agent detection
that isn&rsquo;t working well.</p>
<p>On the web we ended up deciding that user agent detection was not a good
practice and to instead focus on standardization so we can serve the same
HTML/CSS to all browsers. I don&rsquo;t know if the same approach is the future in
the terminal though &ndash; I think the terminal landscape today is much more
fragmented than the web ever was as well as being much less well funded.</p>
<h3 id="some-more-documents-standards">some more documents/standards</h3>
<p>A few more documents and standards related to escape codes, in no particular order:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man4/console_codes.4.html">Linux console_codes man page</a> documents
escape codes that Linux supports</li>
<li>how the <a href="https://vt100.net/docs/vt100-ug/chapter3.html">VT 100</a> handles escape codes &amp; control sequences</li>
<li>the <a href="https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/keyboard-protocol/">kitty keyboard protocol</a></li>
<li><a href="https://gist.github.com/egmontkob/eb114294efbcd5adb1944c9f3cb5feda">OSC 8</a> for links in the terminal (and notes on <a href="https://github.com/Alhadis/OSC8-Adoption?tab=readme-ov-file">adoption</a>)</li>
<li>A <a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux/blob/882fb4d295deb3e4b803eb444915763305114e4f/tools/ansicode.txt">summary of ANSI standards from tmux</a></li>
<li>this <a href="https://iterm2.com/feature-reporting/">terminal features reporting specification from iTerm</a></li>
<li>sixel graphics</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-i-think-this-is-interesting">why I think this is interesting</h3>
<p>I sometimes see people saying that the unix terminal is &ldquo;outdated&rdquo;, and since I
love the terminal so much I&rsquo;m always curious about what incremental changes
might make it feel less &ldquo;outdated&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Maybe if we had a clearer standards landscape (like we do on the web!) it would
be easier for terminal emulator developers to build new features and for
authors of terminal applications to more confidently adopt those features so
that we can all benefit from them and have a richer experience in the terminal.</p>
<p>Obviously standardizing ANSI escape codes is not easy (ECMA-48 was first
published almost 50 years ago and we&rsquo;re still not there!). I don&rsquo;t even know
what all of the challenges are. But the situation with HTML/CSS/JS used to be
extremely bad too and now it&rsquo;s MUCH better, so maybe there&rsquo;s hope.</p>

### [How to add a directory to your PATH](https://jvns.ca/blog/2025/02/13/how-to-add-a-directory-to-your-path/)

**来源**: Julia Evans

**摘要**: <p>I was talking to a friend about how to add a directory to your PATH today. It&rsquo;s
something that feels &ldquo;obvious&rdquo; to me since I&rsquo;ve been using the terminal for a
long time, but when I searched for instructions for how to do it, I actually
couldn&rsquo;t find something that explained all of the steps &ndash; a lot of them just
said &ldquo;add this to <code>~/.bashrc</code>&rdquo;, but what if you&rsquo;re not using bash? What if your
bash config is actually in a different file? And how are you supposed to figure
out which directory to add anyway?</p>
<p>So I wanted to try to write down some more complete directions and mention some
of the gotchas I&rsquo;ve run into over the years.</p>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-1-what-shell-are-you-using">step 1: what shell are you using?</h3>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not sure what shell you&rsquo;re using, here&rsquo;s a way to find out. Run this:</p>
<pre><code>ps -p $$ -o pid,comm=
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>if you&rsquo;re using <strong>bash</strong>, it&rsquo;ll print out <code>97295 bash</code></li>
<li>if you&rsquo;re using <strong>zsh</strong>, it&rsquo;ll print out <code>97295 zsh</code></li>
<li>if you&rsquo;re using <strong>fish</strong>, it&rsquo;ll print out an error like &ldquo;In fish, please use
$fish_pid&rdquo; (<code>$$</code> isn&rsquo;t valid syntax in fish, but in any case the error
message tells you that you&rsquo;re using fish, which you probably already knew)</li>
</ul>
<p>Also bash is the default on Linux and zsh is the default on Mac OS (as of
2024). I&rsquo;ll only cover bash, zsh, and fish in these directions.</p>
<h3 id="step-2-find-your-shell-s-config-file">step 2: find your shell&rsquo;s config file</h3>
<ul>
<li>in zsh, it&rsquo;s probably <code>~/.zshrc</code></li>
<li>in bash, it might be <code>~/.bashrc</code>, but it&rsquo;s complicated, see the note in the next section</li>
<li>in fish, it&rsquo;s probably <code>~/.config/fish/config.fish</code> (you can run <code>echo $__fish_config_dir</code> if you want to be 100% sure)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="a-note-on-bash-s-config-file">a note on bash&rsquo;s config file</h3>
<p>Bash has three possible config files: <code>~/.bashrc</code>, <code>~/.bash_profile</code>, and <code>~/.profile</code>.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not sure which one your system is set up to use, I&rsquo;d recommend
testing this way:</p>
<ol>
<li>add <code>echo hi there</code> to your <code>~/.bashrc</code></li>
<li>Restart your terminal</li>
<li>If you see &ldquo;hi there&rdquo;, that means <code>~/.bashrc</code> is being used! Hooray!</li>
<li>Otherwise remove it and try the same thing with <code>~/.bash_profile</code></li>
<li>You can also try <code>~/.profile</code> if the first two options don&rsquo;t work.</li>
</ol>
<p>(there are a lot of <a href="https://blog.flowblok.id.au/2013-02/shell-startup-scripts.html">elaborate flow charts</a> out there that explain how bash
decides which config file to use but IMO it&rsquo;s not worth it to internalize them
and just testing is the fastest way to be sure)</p>
<h3 id="step-3-figure-out-which-directory-to-add">step 3: figure out which directory to add</h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say that you&rsquo;re trying to install and run a program called <code>http-server</code>
and it doesn&rsquo;t work, like this:</p>
<pre><code>$ npm install -g http-server
$ http-server
bash: http-server: command not found
</code></pre>
<p>How do you find what directory <code>http-server</code> is in? Honestly in general this is
not that easy &ndash; often the answer is something like &ldquo;it depends on how npm is
configured&rdquo;. A few ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Often when setting up a new installer (like <code>cargo</code>, <code>npm</code>, <code>homebrew</code>, etc),
when you first set it up it&rsquo;ll print out some directions about how to update
your PATH. So if you&rsquo;re paying attention you can get the directions then.</li>
<li>Sometimes installers will automatically update your shell&rsquo;s config file
to update your <code>PATH</code> for you</li>
<li>Sometimes just Googling &ldquo;where does npm install things?&rdquo; will turn up the
answer</li>
<li>Some tools have a subcommand that tells you where they&rsquo;re configured to
install things, like:
<ul>
<li>Node/npm: <code>npm config get prefix</code> (then append <code>/bin/</code>)</li>
<li>Go: <code>go env GOPATH</code> (then append <code>/bin/</code>)</li>
<li>asdf: <code>asdf info | grep ASDF_DIR</code> (then append <code>/bin/</code> and <code>/shims/</code>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-3-1-double-check-it-s-the-right-directory">step 3.1: double check it&rsquo;s the right directory</h3>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve found a directory you think might be the right one, make sure it&rsquo;s
actually correct! For example, I found out that on my machine, <code>http-server</code> is
in <code>~/.npm-global/bin</code>. I can make sure that it&rsquo;s the right directory by trying to
run the program <code>http-server</code> in that directory like this:</p>
<pre><code>$ ~/.npm-global/bin/http-server
Starting up http-server, serving ./public
</code></pre>
<p>It worked! Now that you know what directory you need to add to your <code>PATH</code>,
let&rsquo;s move to the next step!</p>
<h3 id="step-4-edit-your-shell-config">step 4: edit your shell config</h3>
<p>Now we have the 2 critical pieces of information we need:</p>
<ol>
<li>Which directory you&rsquo;re trying to add to your PATH (like  <code>~/.npm-global/bin/</code>)</li>
<li>Where your shell&rsquo;s config is (like <code>~/.bashrc</code>, <code>~/.zshrc</code>, or <code>~/.config/fish/config.fish</code>)</li>
</ol>
<p>Now what you need to add depends on your shell:</p>
<p><strong>bash instructions:</strong></p>
<p>Open your shell&rsquo;s config file, and add a line like this:</p>
<pre><code>export PATH=$PATH:~/.npm-global/bin/
</code></pre>
<p>(obviously replace <code>~/.npm-global/bin</code> with the actual directory you&rsquo;re trying to add)</p>
<p><strong>zsh instructions:</strong></p>
<p>You can do the same thing as in bash, but zsh also has some slightly fancier
syntax you can use if you prefer:</p>
<pre><code>path=(
  $path
  ~/.npm-global/bin
)
</code></pre>
<p><strong>fish instructions:</strong></p>
<p>In fish, the syntax is different:</p>
<pre><code>set PATH $PATH ~/.npm-global/bin
</code></pre>
<p>(in fish you can also use <code>fish_add_path</code>, some notes on that <a href="https://jvns.ca/atom.xml#a-note-on-fish-add-path">further down</a>)</p>
<h3 id="step-5-restart-your-shell">step 5: restart your shell</h3>
<p>Now, an extremely important step: updating your shell&rsquo;s config won&rsquo;t take
effect if you don&rsquo;t restart it!</p>
<p>Two ways to do this:</p>
<ol>
<li>open a new terminal (or terminal tab), and maybe close the old one so you don&rsquo;t get confused</li>
<li>Run <code>bash</code> to start a new shell (or <code>zsh</code> if you&rsquo;re using zsh, or <code>fish</code> if you&rsquo;re using fish)</li>
</ol>
<p>I&rsquo;ve found that both of these usually work fine.</p>
<p>And you should be done! Try running the program you were trying to run and
hopefully it works now.</p>
<p>If not, here are a couple of problems that you might run into:</p>
<h3 id="problem-1-it-ran-the-wrong-program">problem 1: it ran the wrong program</h3>
<p>If the wrong <strong>version</strong> of a program is running, you might need to add the
directory to the <em>beginning</em> of your PATH instead of the end.</p>
<p>For example, on my system I have two versions of <code>python3</code> installed, which I
can see by running <code>which -a</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ which -a python3
/usr/bin/python3
/opt/homebrew/bin/python3
</code></pre>
<p>The one your shell will use is the <strong>first one listed</strong>.</p>
<p>If you want to use the Homebrew version, you need to add that directory
(<code>/opt/homebrew/bin</code>) to the <strong>beginning</strong> of your PATH instead, by putting this in
your shell&rsquo;s config file (it&rsquo;s <code>/opt/homebrew/bin/:$PATH</code> instead of the usual <code>$PATH:/opt/homebrew/bin/</code>)</p>
<pre><code>export PATH=/opt/homebrew/bin/:$PATH
</code></pre>
<p>or in fish:</p>
<pre><code>set PATH ~/.cargo/bin $PATH
</code></pre>
<h3 id="problem-2-the-program-isn-t-being-run-from-your-shell">problem 2: the program isn&rsquo;t being run from your shell</h3>
<p>All of these directions only work if you&rsquo;re running the program <strong>from your
shell</strong>. If you&rsquo;re running the program from an IDE, from a GUI, in a cron job,
or some other way, you&rsquo;ll need to add the directory to your PATH in a different
way, and the exact details might depend on the situation.</p>
<p><strong>in a cron job</strong></p>
<p>Some options:</p>
<ul>
<li>use the full path to the program you&rsquo;re running, like <code>/home/bork/bin/my-program</code></li>
<li>put the full PATH you want as the first line of your crontab (something like
PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:&hellip;.). You can get the full PATH you&rsquo;re
using in your shell by running <code>echo &quot;PATH=$PATH&quot;</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m honestly not sure how to handle it in an IDE/GUI because I haven&rsquo;t run into
that in a long time, will add directions here if someone points me in the right
direction.</p>
<h3 id="problem-3-duplicate-path-entries-making-it-harder-to-debug">problem 3: duplicate <code>PATH</code> entries making it harder to debug</h3>
<p>If you edit your path and start a new shell by running <code>bash</code> (or <code>zsh</code>, or
<code>fish</code>), you&rsquo;ll often end up with duplicate <code>PATH</code> entries, because the shell
keeps adding new things to your <code>PATH</code> every time you start your shell.</p>
<p>Personally I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve run into a situation where this kind of
duplication breaks anything, but the duplicates can make it harder to debug
what&rsquo;s going on with your <code>PATH</code> if you&rsquo;re trying to understand its contents.</p>
<p>Some ways you could deal with this:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you&rsquo;re debugging your <code>PATH</code>, open a new terminal to do it in so you get
a &ldquo;fresh&rdquo; state. This should avoid the duplication.</li>
<li>Deduplicate your <code>PATH</code> at the end of your shell&rsquo;s config  (for example in
zsh apparently you can do this with <code>typeset -U path</code>)</li>
<li>Check that the directory isn&rsquo;t already in your <code>PATH</code> when adding it (for
example in fish I believe you can do this with <code>fish_add_path --path /some/directory</code>)</li>
</ol>
<p>How to deduplicate your <code>PATH</code> is shell-specific and there isn&rsquo;t always a
built in way to do it so you&rsquo;ll need to look up how to accomplish it in your
shell.</p>
<h3 id="problem-4-losing-your-history-after-updating-your-path">problem 4: losing your history after updating your <code>PATH</code></h3>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a situation that&rsquo;s easy to get into in bash or zsh:</p>
<ol>
<li>Run a command (it fails)</li>
<li>Update your <code>PATH</code></li>
<li>Run <code>bash</code> to reload your config</li>
<li>Press the up arrow a couple of times to rerun the failed command (or open a new terminal)</li>
<li>The failed command isn&rsquo;t in your history! Why not?</li>
</ol>
<p>This happens because in bash, by default, history is not saved until you exit
the shell.</p>
<p>Some options for fixing this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of running <code>bash</code> to reload your config, run <code>source ~/.bashrc</code> (or
<code>source ~/.zshrc</code> in zsh). This will reload the config inside your current
session.</li>
<li>Configure your shell to continuously save your history instead of only saving
the history when the shell exits. (How to do this depends on whether you&rsquo;re
using bash or zsh, the history options in zsh are a bit complicated and I&rsquo;m
not exactly sure what the best way is)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="a-note-on-source">a note on <code>source</code></h3>
<p>When you install <code>cargo</code> (Rust&rsquo;s installer) for the first time, it gives you
these instructions for how to set up your PATH, which don&rsquo;t mention a specific
directory at all.</p>
<pre><code>This is usually done by running one of the following (note the leading DOT):

. &quot;$HOME/.cargo/env&quot;        	# For sh/bash/zsh/ash/dash/pdksh
source &quot;$HOME/.cargo/env.fish&quot;  # For fish
</code></pre>
<p>The idea is that you add that line to your shell&rsquo;s config, and their script
automatically sets up your <code>PATH</code> (and potentially other things) for you.</p>
<p>This is pretty common (for example <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/install/blob/deacfa6a6e62e5f4002baf9e1fac7a96e9aa5d41/install.sh#L1072-L1087">Homebrew</a> suggests you eval <code>brew shellenv</code>), and there are
two ways to approach this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Just do what the tool suggests (like adding <code>. &quot;$HOME/.cargo/env&quot;</code> to your shell&rsquo;s config)</li>
<li>Figure out which directories the script they&rsquo;re telling you to run would add
to your PATH, and then add those manually. Here&rsquo;s how I&rsquo;d do that:
<ul>
<li>Run <code>. &quot;$HOME/.cargo/env&quot;</code> in my shell (or the fish version if using fish)</li>
<li>Run <code>echo &quot;$PATH&quot; | tr ':' '\n' | grep cargo</code> to figure out which directories it added</li>
<li>See that it says <code>/Users/bork/.cargo/bin</code> and shorten that to <code>~/.cargo/bin</code></li>
<li>Add the directory <code>~/.cargo/bin</code> to PATH (with the directions in this post)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s anything wrong with doing what the tool suggests (it
might be the &ldquo;best way&rdquo;!), but personally I usually use the second approach
because I prefer knowing exactly what configuration I&rsquo;m changing.</p>
<h3 id="a-note-on-fish-add-path">a note on <code>fish_add_path</code></h3>
<p>fish has a handy function called <code>fish_add_path</code> that you can run to add a directory to your <code>PATH</code> like this:</p>
<pre><code>fish_add_path /some/directory
</code></pre>
<p>This is cool (it&rsquo;s such a simple command!) but I&rsquo;ve stopped using it for a couple of reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sometimes <code>fish_add_path</code> will update the <code>PATH</code> for every session in the
future (with a &ldquo;universal variable&rdquo;) and sometimes it will update the <code>PATH</code>
just for the current session and it&rsquo;s hard for me to tell which one it will
do. In theory the docs explain this but I could not understand them.</li>
<li>If you ever need to <em>remove</em> the directory from your <code>PATH</code> a few weeks or
months later because maybe you made a mistake, it&rsquo;s kind of hard to do
(there are <a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8604">instructions in this comments of this github issue though</a>).</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="that-s-all">that&rsquo;s all</h3>
<p>Hopefully this will help some people. Let me know (on Mastodon or Bluesky) if
you there are other major gotchas that have tripped you up when adding a
directory to your PATH, or if you have questions about this post!</p>

### [Some terminal frustrations](https://jvns.ca/blog/2025/02/05/some-terminal-frustrations/)

**来源**: Julia Evans

**摘要**: <p>A few weeks ago I ran a terminal survey (you can <a href="https://jvns.ca/terminal-survey/results-bsky.html">read the results here</a>) and at the end I asked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What’s the most frustrating thing about using the terminal for you?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>1600 people answered, and I decided to spend a few days categorizing all the
responses. Along the way I learned that classifying qualitative data is not
easy but I gave it my best shot. I ended up building a custom
<a href="https://github.com/jvns/classificator">tool</a> to make it faster to categorize
everything.</p>
<p>As with all of my surveys the methodology isn&rsquo;t particularly scientific. I just
posted the survey to Mastodon and Twitter, ran it for a couple of days, and got
answers from whoever happened to see it and felt like responding.</p>
<p>Here are the top categories of frustrations!</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s worth keeping in mind while reading these comments that</p>
<ul>
<li>40% of people answering this survey have been using the terminal for <strong>21+ years</strong></li>
<li>95% of people answering the survey have been using the terminal for at least 4 years</li>
</ul>
<p>These comments aren&rsquo;t coming from total beginners.</p>
<p>Here are the categories of frustrations! The number in brackets is the number
of people with that frustration. I&rsquo;m mostly writing this up for myself because
I&rsquo;m trying to write a zine about the terminal and I wanted to get a sense for
what people are having trouble with.</p>
<h3 id="remembering-syntax-115">remembering syntax (115)</h3>
<p>People talked about struggles remembering:</p>
<ul>
<li>the syntax for CLI tools like awk, jq, sed, etc</li>
<li>the syntax for redirects</li>
<li>keyboard shortcuts for tmux, text editing, etc</li>
</ul>
<p>One example comment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are just so many little &ldquo;trivia&rdquo; details to remember for full
functionality. Even after all these years I&rsquo;ll sometimes forget where it&rsquo;s 2
or 1 for stderr, or forget which is which for <code>&gt;</code> and <code>&gt;&gt;</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="switching-terminals-is-hard-91">switching terminals is hard (91)</h3>
<p>People talked about struggling with switching systems (for example home/work
computer or when SSHing) and running into:</p>
<ul>
<li>OS differences in keyboard shortcuts (like Linux vs Mac)</li>
<li>systems which don&rsquo;t have their preferred text editor (&ldquo;no vim&rdquo; or &ldquo;only vim&rdquo;)</li>
<li>different versions of the same command (like Mac OS grep vs GNU grep)</li>
<li>no tab completion</li>
<li>a shell they aren&rsquo;t used to (&ldquo;the subtle differences between zsh and bash&rdquo;)</li>
</ul>
<p>as well as differences inside the same system like pagers being not consistent
with each other (git diff pagers, other pagers).</p>
<p>One example comment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I got used to fish and vi mode which are not available when I ssh into
servers, containers.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="color-85">color (85)</h3>
<p>Lots of problems with color, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>programs setting colors that are unreadable with a light background color</li>
<li>finding a colorscheme they like (and getting it to work consistently across different apps)</li>
<li>color not working inside several layers of SSH/tmux/etc</li>
<li>not liking the defaults</li>
<li>not wanting color at all and struggling to turn it off</li>
</ul>
<p>This comment felt relatable to me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Getting my terminal theme configured in a reasonable way between the terminal
emulator and fish (I did this years ago and remember it being tedious and
fiddly and now feel like I&rsquo;m locked into my current theme because it works
and I dread touching any of that configuration ever again).</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="keyboard-shortcuts-84">keyboard shortcuts (84)</h3>
<p>Half of the comments on keyboard shortcuts were about how on Linux/Windows, the
keyboard shortcut to copy/paste in the terminal is different from in the rest
of the OS.</p>
<p>Some other issues with keyboard shortcuts other than copy/paste:</p>
<ul>
<li>using <code>Ctrl-W</code> in a browser-based terminal and closing the window</li>
<li>the terminal only supports a limited set of keyboard shortcuts (no
<code>Ctrl-Shift-</code>, no <code>Super</code>, no <code>Hyper</code>, lots of <code>ctrl-</code> shortcuts aren&rsquo;t
possible like <code>Ctrl-,</code>)</li>
<li>the OS stopping you from using a terminal keyboard shortcut (like by default
Mac OS uses <code>Ctrl+left arrow</code> for something else)</li>
<li>issues using emacs in the terminal</li>
<li>backspace not working (2)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="other-copy-and-paste-issues-75">other copy and paste issues (75)</h3>
<p>Aside from &ldquo;the keyboard shortcut for copy and paste is different&rdquo;, there were
a lot of OTHER issues with copy and paste, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>copying over SSH</li>
<li>how tmux and the terminal emulator both do copy/paste in different ways</li>
<li>dealing with many different clipboards (system clipboard, vim clipboard, the
&ldquo;middle click&rdquo; clipboard on Linux, tmux&rsquo;s clipboard, etc) and potentially
synchronizing them</li>
<li>random spaces added when copying from the terminal</li>
<li>pasting multiline commands which automatically get run in a terrifying way</li>
<li>wanting a way to copy text without using the mouse</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="discoverability-55">discoverability (55)</h3>
<p>There were lots of comments about this, which all came down to the same basic
complaint &ndash; it&rsquo;s hard to discover useful tools or features! This comment kind of
summed it all up:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How difficult it is to learn independently. Most of what I know is an
assorted collection of stuff I&rsquo;ve been told by random people over the years.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="steep-learning-curve-44">steep learning curve (44)</h3>
<p>A lot of comments about it generally having a steep learning curve. A couple of
example comments:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After 15 years of using it, I’m not much faster than using it than I was 5 or
maybe even 10 years ago.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That I know I could make my life easier by learning more about the shortcuts
and commands and configuring the terminal but I don&rsquo;t spend the time because it
feels overwhelming.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="history-42">history  (42)</h3>
<p>Some issues with shell history:</p>
<ul>
<li>history not being shared between terminal tabs (16)</li>
<li>limits that are too short (4)</li>
<li>history not being restored when terminal tabs are restored</li>
<li>losing history because the terminal crashed</li>
<li>not knowing how to search history</li>
</ul>
<p>One example comment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It wasted a lot of time until I figured it out and still annoys me that
&ldquo;history&rdquo; on zsh has such a small buffer;  I have to type &ldquo;history 0&rdquo; to get
any useful length of history.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="bad-documentation-37">bad documentation (37)</h3>
<p>People talked about:</p>
<ul>
<li>documentation being generally opaque</li>
<li>lack of examples in man pages</li>
<li>programs which don&rsquo;t have man pages</li>
</ul>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a representative comment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Finding good examples and docs. Man pages often not enough, have to wade
through stack overflow</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="scrollback-36">scrollback (36)</h3>
<p>A few issues with scrollback:</p>
<ul>
<li>programs printing out too much data making you lose scrollback history</li>
<li>resizing the terminal messes up the scrollback</li>
<li>lack of timestamps</li>
<li>GUI programs that you start in the background printing stuff out that gets in
the way of other programs&rsquo; outputs</li>
</ul>
<p>One example comment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When resizing the terminal (in particular: making it narrower) leads to
broken rewrapping of the scrollback content because the commands formatted
their output based on the terminal window width.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="it-feels-outdated-33">&ldquo;it feels outdated&rdquo; (33)</h3>
<p>Lots of comments about how the terminal feels hampered by legacy decisions and
how users often end up needing to learn implementation details that feel very
esoteric. One example comment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most of the legacy cruft, it would be great to have a green field
implementation of the CLI interface.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="shell-scripting-32">shell scripting (32)</h3>
<p>Lots of complaints about POSIX shell scripting. There&rsquo;s a general feeling that
shell scripting is difficult but also that switching to a different less
standard scripting language (fish, nushell, etc) brings its own problems.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shell scripting. My tolerance to ditch a shell script and go to a scripting
language is pretty low. It’s just too messy and powerful. Screwing up can be
costly so I don’t even bother.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="more-issues">more issues</h3>
<p>Some more issues that were mentioned at least 10 times:</p>
<ul>
<li>(31) inconsistent command line arguments: is it -h or help or &ndash;help?</li>
<li>(24) keeping dotfiles in sync across different systems</li>
<li>(23) performance (e.g. &ldquo;my shell takes too long to start&rdquo;)</li>
<li>(20) window management (potentially with some combination of tmux tabs, terminal tabs, and multiple terminal windows. Where did that shell session go?)</li>
<li>(17) generally feeling scared/uneasy (&ldquo;The debilitating fear that I’m going
to do some mysterious Bad Thing with a command and I will have absolutely no
idea how to fix or undo it or even really figure out what happened&rdquo;)</li>
<li>(16) terminfo issues (&ldquo;Having to learn about terminfo if/when I try a new terminal emulator and ssh elsewhere.&rdquo;)</li>
<li>(16) lack of image support (sixel etc)</li>
<li>(15) SSH issues (like having to start over when you lose the SSH connection)</li>
<li>(15) various tmux/screen issues (for example lack of integration between tmux and the terminal emulator)</li>
<li>(15) typos &amp; slow typing</li>
<li>(13) the terminal getting messed up for various reasons (pressing <code>Ctrl-S</code>, <code>cat</code>ing a binary, etc)</li>
<li>(12) quoting/escaping in the shell</li>
<li>(11) various Windows/PowerShell issues</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="n-a-122">n/a (122)</h3>
<p>There were also 122 answers to the effect of &ldquo;nothing really&rdquo; or &ldquo;only that I
can&rsquo;t do EVERYTHING in the terminal&rdquo;</p>
<p>One example comment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Think I&rsquo;ve found work arounds for most/all frustrations</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="that-s-all">that&rsquo;s all!</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to make a lot of commentary on these results, but here are a
couple of categories that feel related to me:</p>
<ul>
<li>remembering syntax &amp; history (often the thing you need to remember is something you&rsquo;ve run before!)</li>
<li>discoverability &amp; the learning curve (the lack of discoverability is definitely a big part of what makes it hard to learn)</li>
<li>&ldquo;switching systems is hard&rdquo; &amp; &ldquo;it feels outdated&rdquo; (tools that haven&rsquo;t really
changed in 30 or 40 years have many problems but they do tend to be always
<em>there</em> no matter what system you&rsquo;re on, which is very useful and makes them
hard to stop using)</li>
</ul>
<p>Trying to categorize all these results in a reasonable way really gave me an
appreciation for social science researchers&rsquo; skills.</p>

### [What's involved in getting a "modern" terminal setup?](https://jvns.ca/blog/2025/01/11/getting-a-modern-terminal-setup/)

**来源**: Julia Evans

**摘要**: <p>Hello! Recently I ran a terminal survey and I asked people what frustrated
them. One person commented:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are so many pieces to having a modern terminal experience. I wish it
all came out of the box.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My immediate reaction was &ldquo;oh, getting a modern terminal experience isn&rsquo;t that
hard, you just need to&hellip;.&rdquo;, but the more I thought about it, the longer the
&ldquo;you just need to&hellip;&rdquo; list got, and I kept thinking about more and more
caveats.</p>
<p>So I thought I would write down some notes about what it means to me personally
to have a &ldquo;modern&rdquo; terminal experience and what I think can make it hard for
people to get there.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-a-modern-terminal-experience">what is a &ldquo;modern terminal experience&rdquo;?</h3>
<p>Here are a few things that are important to me, with which part of the system
is responsible for them:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>multiline support for copy and paste</strong>: if you paste 3 commands in your shell, it should not immediately run them all! That&rsquo;s scary! (<strong>shell</strong>, <strong>terminal emulator</strong>)</li>
<li><strong>infinite shell history</strong>: if I run a command in my shell, it should be saved forever, not deleted after 500 history entries or whatever. Also I want commands to be saved to the history immediately when I run them, not only when I exit the shell session (<strong>shell</strong>)</li>
<li><strong>a useful prompt</strong>: I can&rsquo;t live without having my <strong>current directory</strong> and <strong>current git branch</strong> in my prompt (<strong>shell</strong>)</li>
<li><strong>24-bit colour</strong>: this is important to me because I find it MUCH easier to theme neovim with 24-bit colour support than in a terminal with only 256 colours (<strong>terminal emulator</strong>)</li>
<li><strong>clipboard integration</strong> between vim and my operating system so that when I copy in Firefox, I can just press <code>p</code> in vim to paste (<strong>text editor</strong>, maybe the OS/terminal emulator too)</li>
<li><strong>good autocomplete</strong>: for example commands like git should have command-specific autocomplete (<strong>shell</strong>)</li>
<li><strong>having colours in <code>ls</code></strong> (<strong>shell config</strong>)</li>
<li><strong>a terminal theme I like</strong>: I spend a lot of time in my terminal, I want it to look nice and I want its theme to match my terminal editor&rsquo;s theme. (<strong>terminal emulator</strong>, <strong>text editor</strong>)</li>
<li><strong>automatic terminal fixing</strong>: If a programs prints out some weird escape
codes that mess up my terminal, I want that to automatically get reset so
that my terminal doesn&rsquo;t get messed up (<strong>shell</strong>)</li>
<li><strong>keybindings</strong>: I want <code>Ctrl+left arrow</code> to work (<strong>shell</strong> or <strong>application</strong>)</li>
<li><strong>being able to use the scroll wheel in programs like <code>less</code></strong>: (<strong>terminal emulator</strong> and <strong>applications</strong>)</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a million other terminal conveniences out there and different people
value different things, but those are the ones that I would be really unhappy
without.</p>
<h3 id="how-i-achieve-a-modern-experience">how I achieve a &ldquo;modern experience&rdquo;</h3>
<p>My basic approach is:</p>
<ol>
<li>use the <code>fish</code> shell. Mostly don&rsquo;t configure it, except to:
<ul>
<li>set the <code>EDITOR</code> environment variable to my favourite terminal editor</li>
<li>alias <code>ls</code> to <code>ls --color=auto</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>use any terminal emulator with 24-bit colour support. In the past I&rsquo;ve used
GNOME Terminal, Terminator, and iTerm, but I&rsquo;m not picky about this. I don&rsquo;t really
configure it other than to choose a font.</li>
<li>use <code>neovim</code>, with a configuration that I&rsquo;ve been very slowly building over the last 9 years or so (the last time I deleted my vim config and started from scratch was 9 years ago)</li>
<li>use the <a href="https://github.com/chriskempson/base16">base16 framework</a> to theme everything</li>
</ol>
<p>A few things that affect my approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>I don&rsquo;t spend a lot of time SSHed into other machines</li>
<li>I&rsquo;d rather use the mouse a little than come up with keyboard-based ways to do everything</li>
<li>I work on a lot of small projects, not one big project</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="some-out-of-the-box-options-for-a-modern-experience">some &ldquo;out of the box&rdquo; options for a &ldquo;modern&rdquo; experience</h3>
<p>What if you want a nice experience, but don&rsquo;t want to spend a lot of time on
configuration? Figuring out how to configure vim in a way that I was satisfied
with really did take me like ten years, which is a long time!</p>
<p>My best ideas for how to get a reasonable terminal experience with minimal
config are:</p>
<ul>
<li>shell: either <code>fish</code> or <code>zsh</code> with <a href="https://ohmyz.sh/">oh-my-zsh</a></li>
<li>terminal emulator: almost anything with 24-bit colour support, for example all of these are popular:
<ul>
<li>linux: GNOME Terminal, Konsole, Terminator, xfce4-terminal</li>
<li>mac: iTerm (Terminal.app doesn&rsquo;t have 256-colour support)</li>
<li>cross-platform: kitty, alacritty, wezterm, or ghostty</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>shell config:
<ul>
<li>set the <code>EDITOR</code> environment variable to your favourite terminal text
editor</li>
<li>maybe alias <code>ls</code> to <code>ls --color=auto</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>text editor: this is a tough one, maybe <a href="https://micro-editor.github.io/">micro</a> or <a href="https://helix-editor.com/">helix</a>? I haven&rsquo;t used
either of them seriously but they both seem like very cool projects and I
think it&rsquo;s amazing that you can just use all the usual GUI editor commands
(<code>Ctrl-C</code> to copy, <code>Ctrl-V</code> to paste, <code>Ctrl-A</code> to select all) in micro and
they do what you&rsquo;d expect. I would probably try switching to helix except
that retraining my vim muscle memory seems way too hard. Also helix doesn&rsquo;t
have a GUI or plugin system yet.</li>
</ul>
<p>Personally I <strong>wouldn&rsquo;t</strong> use xterm, rxvt, or Terminal.app as a terminal emulator,
because I&rsquo;ve found in the past that they&rsquo;re missing core features (like 24-bit
colour in Terminal.app&rsquo;s case) that make the terminal harder to use for me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to pretend that getting a &ldquo;modern&rdquo; terminal experience is easier
than it is though &ndash; I think there are two issues that make it hard. Let&rsquo;s talk
about them!</p>
<h3 id="issue-1-with-getting-to-a-modern-experience-the-shell">issue 1 with getting to a &ldquo;modern&rdquo; experience: the shell</h3>
<p>bash and zsh are by far the two most popular shells, and neither of them
provide a default experience that I would be happy using out of the box, for
example:</p>
<ul>
<li>you need to customize your prompt</li>
<li>they don&rsquo;t come with git completions by default, you have to set them up</li>
<li>by default, bash only stores 500 (!) lines of history and (at least on Mac OS)
zsh is only configured to store 2000 lines, which is still not a lot</li>
<li>I find bash&rsquo;s tab completion very frustrating, if there&rsquo;s more than
one match then you can&rsquo;t tab through them</li>
</ul>
<p>And even though <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2024/09/12/reasons-i--still--love-fish/">I love fish</a>, the fact
that it isn&rsquo;t POSIX does make it hard for a lot of folks to make the switch.</p>
<p>Of course it&rsquo;s totally possible to learn how to customize your prompt in bash
or whatever, and it doesn&rsquo;t even need to be that complicated (in bash I&rsquo;d
probably start with something like <code>export PS1='[\u@\h \W$(__git_ps1 &quot; (%s)&quot;)]\$ '</code>, or maybe use <a href="https://starship.rs/">starship</a>).
But each of these &ldquo;not complicated&rdquo; things really does add up and it&rsquo;s
especially tough if you need to keep your config in sync across several
systems.</p>
<p>An extremely popular solution to getting a &ldquo;modern&rdquo; shell experience is
<a href="https://ohmyz.sh/">oh-my-zsh</a>. It seems like a great project and I know a lot
of people use it very happily, but I&rsquo;ve struggled with configuration systems
like that in the past &ndash; it looks like right now the base oh-my-zsh adds about
3000 lines of config, and often I find that having an extra configuration
system makes it harder to debug what&rsquo;s happening when things go wrong. I
personally have a tendency to use the system to add a lot of extra plugins,
make my system slow, get frustrated that it&rsquo;s slow, and then delete it
completely and write a new config from scratch.</p>
<h3 id="issue-2-with-getting-to-a-modern-experience-the-text-editor">issue 2 with getting to a &ldquo;modern&rdquo; experience: the text editor</h3>
<p>In the terminal survey I ran recently, the most popular terminal text editors
by far were <code>vim</code>, <code>emacs</code>, and <code>nano</code>.</p>
<p>I think the main options for terminal text editors are:</p>
<ul>
<li>use vim or emacs and configure it to your liking, you can probably have any
feature you want if you put in the work</li>
<li>use nano and accept that you&rsquo;re going to have a pretty limited experience
(for example I don&rsquo;t think you can select text with the mouse and then &ldquo;cut&rdquo;
it in nano)</li>
<li>use <code>micro</code> or <code>helix</code> which seem to offer a pretty good out-of-the-box
experience, potentially occasionally run into issues with using a less
mainstream text editor</li>
<li>just avoid using a terminal text editor as much as possible, maybe use VSCode, use
VSCode&rsquo;s terminal for all your terminal needs, and mostly never edit files in
the terminal. Or I know a lot of people use <code>code</code> as their <code>EDITOR</code> in the terminal.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="issue-3-individual-applications">issue 3: individual applications</h3>
<p>The last issue is that sometimes individual programs that I use are kind of
annoying. For example on my Mac OS machine, <code>/usr/bin/sqlite3</code> doesn&rsquo;t support
the <code>Ctrl+Left Arrow</code> keyboard shortcut. Fixing this to get a reasonable
terminal experience in SQLite was a little complicated, I had to:</p>
<ul>
<li>realize why this is happening (Mac OS won&rsquo;t ship GNU tools, and &ldquo;Ctrl-Left arrow&rdquo; support comes from GNU readline)</li>
<li>find a workaround (install sqlite from homebrew, which does have readline support)</li>
<li>adjust my environment (put Homebrew&rsquo;s sqlite3 in my PATH)</li>
</ul>
<p>I find that debugging application-specific issues like this is really not easy
and often it doesn&rsquo;t feel &ldquo;worth it&rdquo; &ndash; often I&rsquo;ll end up just dealing with
various minor inconveniences because I don&rsquo;t want to spend hours investigating
them. The only reason I was even able to figure this one out at all is that
I&rsquo;ve been spending a huge amount of time thinking about the terminal recently.</p>
<p>A big part of having a &ldquo;modern&rdquo; experience using terminal programs is just
using newer terminal programs, for example I can&rsquo;t be bothered to learn a
keyboard shortcut to sort the columns in <code>top</code>, but in <code>htop</code>  I can just click
on a column heading with my mouse to sort it. So I use htop instead! But discovering new more &ldquo;modern&rdquo; command line tools isn&rsquo;t easy (though
I made <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2022/04/12/a-list-of-new-ish--command-line-tools/">a list here</a>),
finding ones that I actually like using in practice takes time, and if you&rsquo;re
SSHed into another machine, they won&rsquo;t always be there.</p>
<h3 id="everything-affects-everything-else">everything affects everything else</h3>
<p>Something I find tricky about configuring my terminal to make everything &ldquo;nice&rdquo;
is that changing one seemingly small thing about my workflow can really affect
everything else. For example right now I don&rsquo;t use tmux. But if I needed to use
tmux again (for example because I was doing a lot of work SSHed into another
machine), I&rsquo;d need to think about a few things, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>if I wanted tmux&rsquo;s copy to synchronize with my system clipboard over
SSH, I&rsquo;d need to make sure that my terminal emulator has <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/k1ydpn/a_guide_on_how_to_copy_text_from_anywhere/">OSC 52 support</a></li>
<li>if I wanted to use iTerm&rsquo;s tmux integration (which makes tmux tabs into iTerm
tabs), I&rsquo;d need to change how I configure colours &ndash; right now I set them
with a <a href="https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-shell/blob/588691ba71b47e75793ed9edfcfaa058326a6f41/scripts/base16-solarized-light.sh">shell script</a> that I run when my shell starts, but that means the
colours get lost when restoring a tmux session.</li>
</ul>
<p>and probably more things I haven&rsquo;t thought of. &ldquo;Using tmux means that I have to
change how I manage my colours&rdquo; sounds unlikely, but that really did happen to
me and I decided &ldquo;well, I don&rsquo;t want to change how I manage colours right now,
so I guess I&rsquo;m not using that feature!&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also hard to remember which features I&rsquo;m relying on &ndash; for example maybe
my current terminal <em>does</em> have OSC 52 support and because copying from tmux over SSH
has always Just Worked I don&rsquo;t even realize that that&rsquo;s something I need, and
then it mysteriously stops working when I switch terminals.</p>
<h3 id="change-things-slowly">change things slowly</h3>
<p>Personally even though I think my setup is not <em>that</em> complicated, it&rsquo;s taken
me 20 years to get to this point! Because terminal config changes are so likely
to have unexpected and hard-to-understand consequences, I&rsquo;ve found that if I
change a lot of terminal configuration all at once it makes it much harder to
understand what went wrong if there&rsquo;s a problem, which can be really
disorienting.</p>
<p>So I usually prefer to make pretty small changes, and accept that changes can
might take me a REALLY long time to get used to. For example I switched from
using <code>ls</code> to <a href="https://github.com/eza-community/eza">eza</a> a year or two ago and
while I like it (because <code>eza -l</code> prints human-readable file sizes by default)
I&rsquo;m still not quite sure about it. But also sometimes it&rsquo;s worth it to make a
big change, like I made the switch to fish (from bash) 10 years ago and I&rsquo;m
very happy I did.</p>
<h3 id="getting-a-modern-terminal-is-not-that-easy">getting a &ldquo;modern&rdquo; terminal is not that easy</h3>
<p>Trying to explain how &ldquo;easy&rdquo; it is to configure your terminal really just made
me think that it&rsquo;s kind of hard and that I still sometimes get confused.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve found that there&rsquo;s never one perfect way to configure things in the
terminal that will be compatible with every single other thing. I just need to
try stuff, figure out some kind of locally stable state that works for me, and
accept that if I start using a new tool it might disrupt the system and I might
need to rethink things.</p>

### ["Rules" that terminal programs follow](https://jvns.ca/blog/2024/11/26/terminal-rules/)

**来源**: Julia Evans

**摘要**: <p>Recently I&rsquo;ve been thinking about how everything that happens in the terminal
is some combination of:</p>
<ol>
<li>Your <strong>operating system</strong>&rsquo;s job</li>
<li>Your <strong>shell</strong>&rsquo;s job</li>
<li>Your <strong>terminal emulator</strong>&rsquo;s job</li>
<li>The job of <strong>whatever program you happen to be running</strong> (like <code>top</code> or <code>vim</code> or <code>cat</code>)</li>
</ol>
<p>The first three (your operating system, shell, and terminal emulator) are all kind of
known quantities &ndash; if you&rsquo;re using bash in GNOME Terminal on Linux, you can
more or less reason about how how all of those things interact, and some of
their behaviour is standardized by POSIX.</p>
<p>But the fourth one (&ldquo;whatever program you happen to be running&rdquo;) feels like it
could do ANYTHING. How are you supposed to know how a program is going to
behave?</p>
<p>This post is kind of long so here&rsquo;s a quick table of contents:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://jvns.ca/atom.xml#programs-behave-surprisingly-consistently">programs behave surprisingly consistently</a></li>

<li><a href="https://jvns.ca/atom.xml#these-rules-take-a-long-time-to-learn">these &ldquo;rules&rdquo; take a long time to learn</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="programs-behave-surprisingly-consistently">programs behave surprisingly consistently</h3>
<p>As far as I know, there are no real standards for how programs in the terminal
should behave &ndash; the closest things I know of are:</p>
<ul>
<li>POSIX, which mostly dictates how your terminal emulator / OS / shell should
work together. I think it does specify a few things about how core utilities like
<code>cp</code> should work but AFAIK it doesn&rsquo;t have anything to say about how for
example <code>htop</code> should behave.</li>
<li>these <a href="https://clig.dev/">command line interface guidelines</a></li>
</ul>
<p>But even though there are no standards, in my experience programs in the
terminal behave in a pretty consistent way. So I wanted to write down a list of
&ldquo;rules&rdquo; that in my experience programs mostly follow.</p>
<h3 id="these-are-meant-to-be-descriptive-not-prescriptive">these are meant to be descriptive, not prescriptive</h3>
<p>My goal here isn&rsquo;t to convince authors of terminal programs that they <em>should</em>
follow any of these rules. There are lots of exceptions to these and often
there&rsquo;s a good reason for those exceptions.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s very useful for me to know what behaviour to expect from a random new
terminal program that I&rsquo;m using. Instead of &ldquo;uh, programs could do literally
anything&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;ok, here are the basic rules I expect, and then I can keep a
short mental list of exceptions&rdquo;.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m just writing down what I&rsquo;ve observed about how programs behave in my 20
years of using the terminal, why I think they behave that way, and some
examples of cases where that rule is &ldquo;broken&rdquo;.</p>
<h3 id="it-s-not-always-obvious-which-rules-are-the-program-s-responsibility-to-implement">it&rsquo;s not always obvious which &ldquo;rules&rdquo; are the program&rsquo;s responsibility to implement</h3>
<p>There are a bunch of common conventions that I think are pretty clearly the
program&rsquo;s responsibility to implement, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>config files should go in <code>~/.BLAHrc</code> or <code>~/.config/BLAH/FILE</code> or <code>/etc/BLAH/</code> or something</li>
<li><code>--help</code> should print help text</li>
<li>programs should print &ldquo;regular&rdquo; output to stdout and errors to stderr</li>
</ul>
<p>But in this post I&rsquo;m going to focus on things that it&rsquo;s not 100% obvious are
the program&rsquo;s responsibility. For example it feels to me like a &ldquo;law of nature&rdquo;
that pressing <code>Ctrl-D</code> should quit a REPL, but programs often
need to explicitly implement support for it &ndash; even though <code>cat</code> doesn&rsquo;t need
to implement <code>Ctrl-D</code> support, <code>ipython</code> <a href="https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit/blob/a2a12300c635ab3c051566e363ed27d853af4b21/src/prompt_toolkit/shortcuts/prompt.py#L824-L837">does</a>. (more about that in &ldquo;rule 3&rdquo; below)</p>
<p>Understanding which things are the program&rsquo;s responsibility makes it much less
surprising when different programs&rsquo; implementations are slightly different.</p>
<h3 id="rule-1-noninteractive-programs-should-quit-when-you-press-ctrl-c">rule 1: noninteractive programs should quit when you press <code>Ctrl-C</code></h3>
<p>The main reason for this rule is that noninteractive programs will quit by
default on <code>Ctrl-C</code> if they don&rsquo;t set up a <code>SIGINT</code> signal handler, so this is
kind of a &ldquo;you should act like the default&rdquo; rule.</p>
<p>Something that trips a lot of people up is that this doesn&rsquo;t apply to
<strong>interactive</strong> programs like <code>python3</code> or <code>bc</code> or <code>less</code>. This is because in
an interactive program, <code>Ctrl-C</code> has a different job &ndash; if the program is
running an operation (like for example a search in <code>less</code> or some Python code
in <code>python3</code>), then <code>Ctrl-C</code> will interrupt that operation but not stop the
program.</p>
<p>As an example of how this works in an interactive program: here&rsquo;s the code <a href="https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit/blob/a2a12300c635ab3c051566e363ed27d853af4b21/src/prompt_toolkit/key_binding/bindings/vi.py#L2225">in prompt-toolkit</a> (the library that iPython uses for handling input)
that aborts a search when you press <code>Ctrl-C</code>.</p>
<h3 id="rule-2-tuis-should-quit-when-you-press-q">rule 2: TUIs should quit when you press <code>q</code></h3>
<p>TUI programs (like <code>less</code> or <code>htop</code>) will usually quit when you press <code>q</code>.</p>
<p>This rule doesn&rsquo;t apply to any program where pressing <code>q</code> to quit wouldn&rsquo;t make
sense, like <code>tmux</code> or text editors.</p>
<h3 id="rule-3-repls-should-quit-when-you-press-ctrl-d-on-an-empty-line">rule 3: REPLs should quit when you press <code>Ctrl-D</code> on an empty line</h3>
<p>REPLs (like <code>python3</code> or <code>ed</code>) will usually quit when you press <code>Ctrl-D</code> on an
empty line. This rule is similar to the <code>Ctrl-C</code> rule &ndash; the reason for this is
that by default if you&rsquo;re running a program (like <code>cat</code>) in &ldquo;cooked mode&rdquo;, then
the operating system will return an <code>EOF</code> when you press <code>Ctrl-D</code> on an empty
line.</p>
<p>Most of the REPLs I use (sqlite3, python3, fish, bash, etc) don&rsquo;t actually use
cooked mode, but they all implement this keyboard shortcut anyway to mimic the
default behaviour.</p>
<p>For example, here&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit/blob/a2a12300c635ab3c051566e363ed27d853af4b21/src/prompt_toolkit/shortcuts/prompt.py#L824-L837">the code in prompt-toolkit</a>
that quits when you press Ctrl-D, and here&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/bminor/bash/blob/6794b5478f660256a1023712b5fc169196ed0a22/lib/readline/readline.c#L658-L672">the same code in readline</a>.</p>
<p>I actually thought that this one was a &ldquo;Law of Terminal Physics&rdquo; until very
recently because I&rsquo;ve basically never seen it broken, but you can see that it&rsquo;s
just something that each individual input library has to implement in the links
above.</p>
<p>Someone pointed out that the Erlang REPL does not quit when you press <code>Ctrl-D</code>,
so I guess not every REPL follows this &ldquo;rule&rdquo;.</p>
<h3 id="rule-4-don-t-use-more-than-16-colours">rule 4: don&rsquo;t use more than 16 colours</h3>
<p>Terminal programs rarely use colours other than the base 16 ANSI colours. This
is because if you specify colours with a hex code, it&rsquo;s very likely to clash
with some users&rsquo; background colour. For example if I print out some text as
<code>#EEEEEE</code>, it would be almost invisible on a white background, though it would
look fine on a dark background.</p>
<p>But if you stick to the default 16 base colours, you have a much better chance
that the user has configured those colours in their terminal emulator so that
they work reasonably well with their background color. Another reason to stick
to the default base 16 colours is that it makes less assumptions about what
colours the terminal emulator supports.</p>
<p>The only programs I usually see breaking this &ldquo;rule&rdquo; are text editors, for
example Helix by default will use a purple background which is not a default
ANSI colour. It seems fine for Helix to break this rule since Helix isn&rsquo;t a
&ldquo;core&rdquo; program and I assume any Helix user who doesn&rsquo;t like that colorscheme
will just change the theme.</p>
<h3 id="rule-5-vaguely-support-readline-keybindings">rule 5: vaguely support readline keybindings</h3>
<p>Almost every program I use supports <code>readline</code> keybindings if it would make
sense to do so. For example, here are a bunch of different programs and a link
to where they define <code>Ctrl-E</code> to go to the end of the line:</p>
<ul>
<li>ipython (<a href="https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit/blob/a2a12300c635ab3c051566e363ed27d853af4b21/src/prompt_toolkit/key_binding/bindings/emacs.py#L72">Ctrl-E defined here</a>)</li>
<li>atuin (<a href="https://github.com/atuinsh/atuin/blob/a67cfc82fe0dc907a01f07a0fd625701e062a33b/crates/atuin/src/command/client/search/interactive.rs#L407">Ctrl-E defined here</a>)</li>
<li>fzf (<a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/blob/bb55045596d6d08445f3c6d320c3ec2b457462d1/src/terminal.go#L611">Ctrl-E defined here</a>)</li>
<li>zsh (<a href="https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh/blob/86d5f24a3d28541f242eb3807379301ea976de87/Src/Zle/zle_bindings.c#L94">Ctrl-E defined here</a>)</li>
<li>fish (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/blob/99fa8aaaa7956178973150a03ce4954ab17a197b/share/functions/fish_default_key_bindings.fish#L43">Ctrl-E defined here</a>)</li>
<li>tmux&rsquo;s command prompt (<a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux/blob/ae8f2208c98e3c2d6e3fe4cad2281dce8fd11f31/key-bindings.c#L490">Ctrl-E defined here</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>None of those programs actually uses <code>readline</code> directly, they just sort of
mimic emacs/readline keybindings. They don&rsquo;t always mimic them <em>exactly</em>: for
example atuin seems to use <code>Ctrl-A</code> as a prefix, so <code>Ctrl-A</code> doesn&rsquo;t go to the
beginning of the line.</p>
<p>Also all of these programs seem to implement their own internal cut and paste
buffers so you can delete a line with <code>Ctrl-U</code> and then paste it with <code>Ctrl-Y</code>.</p>
<p>The exceptions to this are:</p>
<ul>
<li>some programs (like <code>git</code>, <code>cat</code>, and <code>nc</code>) don&rsquo;t have any line editing support at all (except for backspace, <code>Ctrl-W</code>, and <code>Ctrl-U</code>)</li>
<li>as usual text editors are an exception, every text editor has its own
approach to editing text</li>
</ul>
<p>I wrote more about this &ldquo;what keybindings does a program support?&rdquo; question in
<a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2024/07/08/readline/">entering text in the terminal is complicated</a>.</p>
<h3 id="rule-5-1-ctrl-w-should-delete-the-last-word">rule 5.1: Ctrl-W should delete the last word</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never seen a program (other than a text editor) where <code>Ctrl-W</code> <em>doesn&rsquo;t</em>
delete the last word. This is similar to the <code>Ctrl-C</code> rule &ndash; by default if a
program is in &ldquo;cooked mode&rdquo;, the OS will delete the last word if you press
<code>Ctrl-W</code>, and delete the whole line if you press <code>Ctrl-U</code>. So usually programs
will imitate that behaviour.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t think of any exceptions to this other than text editors but if there
are I&rsquo;d love to hear about them!</p>
<h3 id="rule-6-disable-colours-when-writing-to-a-pipe">rule 6: disable colours when writing to a pipe</h3>
<p>Most programs will disable colours when writing to a pipe. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>rg blah</code> will highlight all occurrences of <code>blah</code> in the output, but if the
output is to a pipe or a file, it&rsquo;ll turn off the highlighting.</li>
<li><code>ls --color=auto</code> will use colour when writing to a terminal, but not when
writing to a pipe</li>
</ul>
<p>Both of those programs will also format their output differently when writing
to the terminal: <code>ls</code> will organize files into columns, and ripgrep will group
matches with headings.</p>
<p>If you want to force the program to use colour (for example because you want to
look at the colour), you can use <code>unbuffer</code> to force the program&rsquo;s output to be
a tty like this:</p>
<pre><code>unbuffer rg blah |  less -R
</code></pre>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that there are some programs that &ldquo;break&rdquo; this rule but I can&rsquo;t think
of any examples right now. Some programs have an <code>--color</code> flag that you can
use to force colour to be on, in the example above you could also do <code>rg --color=always | less -R</code>.</p>
<h3 id="rule-7-means-stdin-stdout">rule 7: <code>-</code> means stdin/stdout</h3>
<p>Usually if you pass <code>-</code> to a program instead of a filename, it&rsquo;ll read from
stdin or write to stdout (whichever is appropriate). For example, if you want
to format the Python code that&rsquo;s on your clipboard with <code>black</code> and then copy
it, you could run:</p>
<pre><code>pbpaste | black - | pbcopy
</code></pre>
<p>(<code>pbpaste</code> is a Mac program, you can do something similar on Linux with <code>xclip</code>)</p>
<p>My impression is that most programs implement this if it would make sense and I
can&rsquo;t think of any exceptions right now, but I&rsquo;m sure there are many
exceptions.</p>
<h3 id="these-rules-take-a-long-time-to-learn">these &ldquo;rules&rdquo; take a long time to learn</h3>
<p>These rules took me a long time for me to learn because I had to:</p>
<ol>
<li>learn that the rule applied anywhere at all (&quot;<code>Ctrl-C</code> will exit programs&quot;)</li>
<li>notice some exceptions (&ldquo;okay, <code>Ctrl-C</code> will exit <code>find</code> but not <code>less</code>&rdquo;)</li>
<li>subconsciously figure out what the pattern is (&quot;<code>Ctrl-C</code> will generally quit
noninteractive programs, but in interactive programs it might interrupt the
current operation instead of quitting the program&quot;)</li>
<li>eventually maybe formulate it into an explicit rule that I know</li>
</ol>
<p>A lot of my understanding of the terminal is honestly still in the
&ldquo;subconscious pattern recognition&rdquo; stage. The only reason I&rsquo;ve been taking the
time to make things explicit at all is because I&rsquo;ve been trying to explain how
it works to others. Hopefully writing down these &ldquo;rules&rdquo; explicitly will make
learning some of this stuff a little bit faster for others.</p>

### [Why pipes sometimes get "stuck": buffering](https://jvns.ca/blog/2024/11/29/why-pipes-get-stuck-buffering/)

**来源**: Julia Evans

**摘要**: <p>Here&rsquo;s a niche terminal problem that has bothered me for years but that I never
really understood until a few weeks ago. Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re running this command
to watch for some specific output in a log file:</p>
<pre><code>tail -f /some/log/file | grep thing1 | grep thing2
</code></pre>
<p>If log lines are being added to the file relatively slowly, the result I&rsquo;d see
is&hellip; nothing! It doesn&rsquo;t matter if there were matches in the log file or not,
there just wouldn&rsquo;t be any output.</p>
<p>I internalized this as &ldquo;uh, I guess pipes just get stuck sometimes and don&rsquo;t
show me the output, that&rsquo;s weird&rdquo;, and I&rsquo;d handle it by just
running <code>grep thing1 /some/log/file | grep thing2</code> instead, which would work.</p>
<p>So as I&rsquo;ve been doing a terminal deep dive over the last few months I was
really excited to finally learn exactly why this happens.</p>
<h3 id="why-this-happens-buffering">why this happens: buffering</h3>
<p>The reason why &ldquo;pipes get stuck&rdquo; sometimes is that it&rsquo;s VERY common for
programs to buffer their output before writing it to a pipe or file. So the
pipe is working fine, the problem is that the program never even wrote the data
to the pipe!</p>
<p>This is for performance reasons: writing all output immediately as soon as you
can uses more system calls, so it&rsquo;s more efficient to save up data until you
have 8KB or so of data to write (or until the program exits) and THEN write it
to the pipe.</p>
<p>In this example:</p>
<pre><code>tail -f /some/log/file | grep thing1 | grep thing2
</code></pre>
<p>the problem is that <code>grep thing1</code> is saving up all of its matches until it has
8KB of data to write, which might literally never happen.</p>
<h3 id="programs-don-t-buffer-when-writing-to-a-terminal">programs don&rsquo;t buffer when writing to a terminal</h3>
<p>Part of why I found this so disorienting is that <code>tail -f file | grep thing</code>
will work totally fine, but then when you add the second <code>grep</code>, it stops
working!! The reason for this is that the way <code>grep</code> handles buffering depends
on whether it&rsquo;s writing to a terminal or not.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how <code>grep</code> (and many other programs) decides to buffer its output:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check if stdout is a terminal or not using the <code>isatty</code> function
<ul>
<li>If it&rsquo;s a terminal, use line buffering (print every line immediately as soon as you have it)</li>
<li>Otherwise, use &ldquo;block buffering&rdquo; &ndash; only print data if you have at least 8KB or so of data to print</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So if <code>grep</code> is writing directly to your terminal then you&rsquo;ll see the line as
soon as it&rsquo;s printed, but if it&rsquo;s writing to a pipe, you won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Of course the buffer size isn&rsquo;t always 8KB for every program, it depends on the implementation. For <code>grep</code> the buffering is handled by libc, and libc&rsquo;s buffer size is
defined in the <code>BUFSIZ</code> variable. <a href="https://github.com/bminor/glibc/blob/c69e8cccaff8f2d89cee43202623b33e6ef5d24a/libio/stdio.h#L100">Here&rsquo;s where that&rsquo;s defined in glibc</a>.</p>
<p>(as an aside: &ldquo;programs do not use 8KB output buffers when writing to a
terminal&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t, like, a law of terminal physics, a program COULD use an 8KB
buffer when writing output to a terminal if it wanted, it would just be
extremely weird if it did that, I can&rsquo;t think of any program that behaves that
way)</p>
<h3 id="commands-that-buffer-commands-that-don-t">commands that buffer &amp; commands that don&rsquo;t</h3>
<p>One annoying thing about this buffering behaviour is that you kind of need to
remember which commands buffer their output when writing to a pipe.</p>
<p>Some commands that <strong>don&rsquo;t</strong> buffer their output:</p>
<ul>
<li>tail</li>
<li>cat</li>
<li>tee</li>
</ul>
<p>I think almost everything else will buffer output, especially if it&rsquo;s a command
where you&rsquo;re likely to be using it for batch processing. Here&rsquo;s a list of some
common commands that buffer their output when writing to a pipe, along with the
flag that disables block buffering.</p>
<ul>
<li>grep (<code>--line-buffered</code>)</li>
<li>sed (<code>-u</code>)</li>
<li>awk (there&rsquo;s a <code>fflush()</code> function)</li>
<li>tcpdump (<code>-l</code>)</li>
<li>jq (<code>-u</code>)</li>
<li>tr (<code>-u</code>)</li>
<li>cut (can&rsquo;t disable buffering)</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are all the ones I can think of, lots of unix commands (like <code>sort</code>) may
or may not buffer their output but it doesn&rsquo;t matter because <code>sort</code> can&rsquo;t do
anything until it finishes receiving input anyway.</p>
<p>Also I did my best to test both the Mac OS and GNU versions of these but there
are a lot of variations and I might have made some mistakes.</p>
<h3 id="programming-languages-where-the-default-print-statement-buffers">programming languages where the default &ldquo;print&rdquo; statement buffers</h3>
<p>Also, here are a few programming language where the default print statement
will buffer output when writing to a pipe, and some ways to disable buffering
if you want:</p>
<ul>
<li>C (disable with <code>setvbuf</code>)</li>
<li>Python (disable with <code>python -u</code>, or <code>PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1</code>, or <code>sys.stdout.reconfigure(line_buffering=False)</code>, or <code>print(x, flush=True)</code>)</li>
<li>Ruby (disable with <code>STDOUT.sync = true</code>)</li>
<li>Perl (disable with <code>$| = 1</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>I assume that these languages are designed this way so that the default print
function will be fast when you&rsquo;re doing batch processing.</p>
<p>Also whether output is buffered or not might depend on how you print, for
example in C++ <code>cout &lt;&lt; &quot;hello\n&quot;</code> buffers when writing to a pipe but <code>cout &lt;&lt; &quot;hello&quot; &lt;&lt; endl</code> will flush its output.</p>
<h3 id="when-you-press-ctrl-c-on-a-pipe-the-contents-of-the-buffer-are-lost">when you press <code>Ctrl-C</code> on a pipe, the contents of the buffer are lost</h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re running this command as a hacky way to watch for DNS requests
to <code>example.com</code>, and you forgot to pass <code>-l</code> to tcpdump:</p>
<pre><code>sudo tcpdump -ni any port 53 | grep example.com
</code></pre>
<p>When you press <code>Ctrl-C</code>, what happens? In a magical perfect world, what I would
<em>want</em> to happen is for <code>tcpdump</code> to flush its buffer, <code>grep</code> would search for
<code>example.com</code>, and I would see all the output I missed.</p>
<p>But in the real world, what happens is that all the programs get killed and the
output in <code>tcpdump</code>&rsquo;s buffer is lost.</p>
<p>I think this problem is probably unavoidable &ndash; I spent a little time with
<code>strace</code> to see how this works and <code>grep</code> receives the <code>SIGINT</code> before
<code>tcpdump</code> anyway so even if <code>tcpdump</code> tried to flush its buffer <code>grep</code> would
already be dead.</p>
<small>
<p>After a little more investigation, there is a workaround: if you find
<code>tcpdump</code>&rsquo;s PID and <code>kill -TERM $PID</code>, then tcpdump will flush the buffer so
you can see the output. That&rsquo;s kind of a pain but I tested it and it seems to
work.</p>
</small>
<h3 id="redirecting-to-a-file-also-buffers">redirecting to a file also buffers</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just pipes, this will also buffer:</p>
<pre><code>sudo tcpdump -ni any port 53 &gt; output.txt
</code></pre>
<p>Redirecting to a file doesn&rsquo;t have the same &ldquo;<code>Ctrl-C</code> will totally destroy the
contents of the buffer&rdquo; problem though &ndash; in my experience it usually behaves
more like you&rsquo;d want, where the contents of the buffer get written to the file
before the program exits. I&rsquo;m not 100% sure whether this is something you can
always rely on or not.</p>
<h3 id="a-bunch-of-potential-ways-to-avoid-buffering">a bunch of potential ways to avoid buffering</h3>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s talk solutions. Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;ve run this command:</p>
<pre><code>tail -f /some/log/file | grep thing1 | grep thing2
</code></pre>
<p>I asked people on Mastodon how they would solve this in practice and there were
5 basic approaches. Here they are:</p>
<h4 id="solution-1-run-a-program-that-finishes-quickly">solution 1: run a program that finishes quickly</h4>
<p>Historically my solution to this has been to just avoid the &ldquo;command writing to
pipe slowly&rdquo; situation completely and instead run a program that will finish quickly
like this:</p>
<pre><code>cat /some/log/file | grep thing1 | grep thing2 | tail
</code></pre>
<p>This doesn&rsquo;t do the same thing as the original command but it does mean that
you get to avoid thinking about these weird buffering issues.</p>
<p>(you could also do <code>grep thing1 /some/log/file</code> but I often prefer to use an
&ldquo;unnecessary&rdquo; <code>cat</code>)</p>
<h4 id="solution-2-remember-the-line-buffer-flag-to-grep">solution 2: remember the &ldquo;line buffer&rdquo; flag to grep</h4>
<p>You could remember that grep has a flag to avoid buffering and pass it like this:</p>
<pre><code>tail -f /some/log/file | grep --line-buffered thing1 | grep thing2
</code></pre>
<h4 id="solution-3-use-awk">solution 3: use awk</h4>
<p>Some people said that if they&rsquo;re specifically dealing with a multiple greps
situation, they&rsquo;ll rewrite it to use a single <code>awk</code> instead, like this:</p>
<pre><code>tail -f /some/log/file |  awk '/thing1/ &amp;&amp; /thing2/'
</code></pre>
<p>Or you would write a more complicated <code>grep</code>, like this:</p>
<pre><code>tail -f /some/log/file |  grep -E 'thing1.*thing2'
</code></pre>
<p>(<code>awk</code> also buffers, so for this to work you&rsquo;ll want <code>awk</code> to be the last command in the pipeline)</p>
<h4 id="solution-4-use-stdbuf">solution 4: use <code>stdbuf</code></h4>
<p><code>stdbuf</code> uses LD_PRELOAD to turn off libc&rsquo;s buffering, and you can use it to turn off output buffering like this:</p>
<pre><code>tail -f /some/log/file | stdbuf -o0 grep thing1 | grep thing2
</code></pre>
<p>Like any <code>LD_PRELOAD</code> solution it&rsquo;s a bit unreliable &ndash; it doesn&rsquo;t work on
static binaries, I think won&rsquo;t work if the program isn&rsquo;t using libc&rsquo;s
buffering, and doesn&rsquo;t always work on Mac OS. Harry Marr has a really nice <a href="https://hmarr.com/blog/how-stdbuf-works/">How stdbuf works</a> post.</p>
<h4 id="solution-5-use-unbuffer">solution 5: use <code>unbuffer</code></h4>
<p><code>unbuffer program</code> will force the program&rsquo;s output to be a TTY, which means
that it&rsquo;ll behave the way it normally would on a TTY (less buffering, colour
output, etc). You could use it in this example like this:</p>
<pre><code>tail -f /some/log/file | unbuffer grep thing1 | grep thing2
</code></pre>
<p>Unlike <code>stdbuf</code> it will always work, though it might have unwanted side
effects, for example <code>grep thing1</code>&rsquo;s will also colour matches.</p>
<p>If you want to install unbuffer, it&rsquo;s in the <code>expect</code> package.</p>
<h3 id="that-s-all-the-solutions-i-know-about">that&rsquo;s all the solutions I know about!</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bit hard for me to say which one is &ldquo;best&rdquo;, I think personally I&rsquo;m
mostly likely to use <code>unbuffer</code> because I know it&rsquo;s always going to work.</p>
<p>If I learn about more solutions I&rsquo;ll try to add them to this post.</p>
<h3 id="i-m-not-really-sure-how-often-this-comes-up">I&rsquo;m not really sure how often this comes up</h3>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s not very common for me to have a program that slowly trickles data
into a pipe like this, normally if I&rsquo;m using a pipe a bunch of data gets
written very quickly, processed by everything in the pipeline, and then
everything exits. The only examples I can come up with right now are:</p>
<ul>
<li>tcpdump</li>
<li><code>tail -f</code></li>
<li>watching log files in a different way like with <code>kubectl logs</code></li>
<li>the output of a slow computation</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-if-there-were-an-environment-variable-to-disable-buffering">what if there were an environment variable to disable buffering?</h3>
<p>I think it would be cool if there were a standard environment variable to turn
off buffering, like <code>PYTHONUNBUFFERED</code> in Python. I got this idea from a
<a href="https://blog.plover.com/Unix/stdio-buffering.html">couple</a> of <a href="https://blog.plover.com/Unix/stdio-buffering-2.html">blog posts</a> by Mark Dominus
in 2018. Maybe <code>NO_BUFFER</code> like <a href="https://no-color.org/">NO_COLOR</a>?</p>
<p>The design seems tricky to get right; Mark points out that NETBSD has <a href="https://man.netbsd.org/setbuf.3">environment variables called <code>STDBUF</code>, <code>STDBUF1</code>, etc</a> which gives you a
ton of control over buffering but I imagine most developers don&rsquo;t want to
implement many different environment variables to handle a relatively minor
edge case.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also curious about whether there are any programs that just automatically
flush their output buffers after some period of time (like 1 second). It feels
like it would be nice in theory but I can&rsquo;t think of any program that does that
so I imagine there are some downsides.</p>
<h3 id="stuff-i-left-out">stuff I left out</h3>
<p>Some things I didn&rsquo;t talk about in this post since these posts have been
getting pretty long recently and seriously does anyone REALLY want to read 3000
words about buffering?</p>
<ul>
<li>the difference between line buffering and having totally unbuffered output</li>
<li>how buffering to stderr is different from buffering to stdout</li>
<li>this post is only about buffering that happens <strong>inside the program</strong>, your
operating system&rsquo;s TTY driver also does a little bit of buffering sometimes</li>
<li>other reasons you might need to flush your output other than &ldquo;you&rsquo;re writing
to a pipe&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

### [2025 Recap: so many projects](https://fasterthanli.me/articles/2025-recap)

### [Introducing arborium, a tree-sitter distribution](https://fasterthanli.me/articles/introducing-arborium)

**摘要**: <p>About two weeks ago I entered a discussion with the docs.rs team about,
basically, why we have to look at this:</p>

In an effort to understand those reasons, I opened a GitHub issue which resulted
in a <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/docs.rs/issues/3040">short but productive</a> discussion.</p>

<p>I walked away discouraged, and then decided to, reasons be damned, attack this
problem from three different angles.</p>

**摘要**: <p>Earlier this week, an <a href="https://fasterthanli.me/articles/color-npm-package-compromised">npm supply chain attack</a>.</p>

<p>It’s turn for <a href="https://crates.io">crates.io</a>, the main public repository for <a href="https://rust-lang.org">Rust</a>
crates (packages).</p>

<p>The phishing e-mail looks like this:</p>

<figure class="paragraph-like"><source media="(max-width: 400px)" type="image/jxl" /><source type="image/jxl" /><source media="(max-width: 400px)" type="image/avif" /><source type="image/avif" /><source media="(max-width: 400px)" type="image/webp" /><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="A phishing e-mail: Important: Breach notification regarding crates.io  Hi, BurntSushi! We recently discovered that an unauthorized actor had compromised the crates.io infrastructure and accessed a limited amount of user information. The attacker's access was revoked, and we are currently reviewing our security posture. We are currently drafting a blog post to outline the timeline and the steps we took to mitigate this. In the meantime, we strongly suggest you to rotate your login info by signing in here to our internal SSO, which is a temporary fix to ensure that the attacker cannot modify any packages published by you.

<p>The <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/governance/teams/dev-tools#team-crates-io">crates.io team</a> has acknowledged

### [color npm package compromised](https://fasterthanli.me/articles/color-npm-package-compromised)

**摘要**: <p>On September 8 2025, around 13:00 UTC, someone compromised <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/~qix">Josh Junon’s npm
account (qix)</a> and started publishing backdoored
versions of his package.</p>

<p>Someone noticed and let Josh know:</p>

<figure class="paragraph-like"><source media="(max-width: 400px)" type="image/jxl" /><source media="(max-width: 900px)" type="image/jxl" /><source type="image/jxl" /><source media="(max-width: 400px)" type="image/avif" /><source media="(max-width: 900px)" type="image/avif" /><source type="image/avif" /><source media="(max-width: 400px)" type="image/webp" /><source media="(max-width: 900px)" type="image/webp" /><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="Hey. Your npm account seems to have been compromised. 1 hour ago it started posting packages with backdoors to all your popular packages.

</a></cite></figcaption>
</figure><p>Josh confirmed he’d gotten pwned by a fake 2FA (two-factor authentication) reset e-mail:</p>

<figure class="paragraph-like"><source media="(max-width: 400px)" type="image/jxl" /><source media="(max-width: 900px)" type="image/jxl" /><source type="image/jxl" /><source media="(max-width: 400px)" type="image/avif" /><source media="(max-width: 900px)" type="image/avif" /><source type="image/avif" /><source media="(max-width: 400px)" type="image/webp" /><source media="(max-width: 900px)" type="image/webp" /><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="Yep, I've been pwned. 2FA reset email, looked very legitimate.  Only NPM affected. I've sent an email off to @npmjs.bsky.social  to see if I can get access again.  Sorry everyone, I should have paid more attention. Not like me; have had a stressful week. Will work to get this cleaned up.

</figure><p>The phishing e-mail came from <code>npmsj.help</code> (registered 3 days prior) and claimed
users had to reset their 2FA:</p>

### [All color is best-effort](https://fasterthanli.me/articles/all-color-is-best-effort)

**来源**: Amos (fasterthanlime)

**摘要**: <p>I do not come to you with answers today, but rather some observations and a lot of questions.</p>

<a class="anchor" href="https://fasterthanli.me/index.xml#the-weird-glitch" id="the-weird-glitch"><h2>The weird glitch</h2></a>
<p>Recently I was editing some video and I noticed this:</p>

<p>



<source media="(max-width: 400px)" type="image/jxl" /><source media="(max-width: 900px)" type="image/jxl" /><source type="image/jxl" /><source media="(max-width: 400px)" type="image/avif" /><source media="(max-width: 900px)" type="image/avif" /><source type="image/avif" /><source media="(max-width: 400px)" type="image/webp" /><source media="(max-width: 900px)" type="image/webp" /><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="A screenshot of the video, there are visible circles at various places in the image. Some of them are black, some of them are white. The image itself shows some blue and white text composited on some blurry background, which doesn’t really matter for this, and there’s a red line horizontal up in the image. It’s very confusing." height="1126" src="https://cdn.fasterthanli.me/content/articles/all-color-is-best-effort/dvr-circles@2x~3c031f1f42693336.jxl" title="A screenshot of the video, there are visible circles at various places in the image.

It’s very confusing." width="1966" /></p>

<p>Not what the finger is pointing at — the dots.</p>

<p>Here are the separate layers this image is made up of: the background is a stock image
I’ve licensed from Envato Elements:</p>

<p><source media="(max-width: 400px)" type="image/jxl" /><source media="(max-width: 900px)" type="image/jxl" /><source type="image/jxl" /><source media="(max-width: 400px)" type="image/avif" /><source media="(max-width: 900px)" type="image/avif" /><source type="image/avif" /><source media="(max-width: 400px)" type="image/webp" /><source media="(max-width: 900px)" type="image/webp" /><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="A picture of a canyon, darker than you’d expect." height="1126" src="https://cdn.fasterthanli.me/content/articles/all-color-is-best-effort/canyon-background@2x~dcfb5771209ddbd5.jxl" title="A picture of a canyon, darker than you’d expect." width="1966" /></p>

<p>Because I use it as a background image, I’ve cranked down the exposition in the Color tab:</p>

**来源**: Lobsters (Tech News)

**摘要**: <p>Hi lobsters - I'm interested in your thoughts on home routers. I have used the crummy ones provided by my ISPs for years (currently I have something called a FritzBox), but I'm increasingly considering getting something a bit more customisable.</p>
<p>My requirements are minimal. My flat is small so coverage is not a problem. I would like to do some DNS filtering so if I can run pihole or similar on the router itself that's a plus. I would love better logs in the event of network issues. Tell me about your setups/experiences? :)</p>
