### ["The first two weeks are the hardest": my first digital declutter](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/eeFqTjmZ8kS7S5tpg/the-first-two-weeks-are-the-hardest-my-first-digital)

**来源**: LessWrong - AI

**摘要**: Published on January 18, 2026 10:04 PM GMT<br /><br /><p>It is unbearable to not be consuming. All through the house is nothing but silence. The need inside of me is not an ache, it is caustic, sour, the burning desire to be distracted, to be listening, watching, scrolling.</p><p>Some of the time I think I’m happy. I think this is very good. I go to the park and lie on a blanket in a sun with a book and a notebook. I watch the blades of grass and the kids and the dogs and the butterflies and I’m so happy to be free.</p><p>Then there are the nights. The dark silence is so oppressive, so all-consuming. One lonely night, early on, I bike to a space where I had sometimes felt welcome, and thought I might again.</p><p>“What are you doing here?” the people ask.</p><p>“I’m three days into my month of digital minimalism and I’m so bored, I just wanted to be around people.”</p><p>No one really wants to be around me. Okay.</p><p>One of the guys had a previous life as a digital minimalism coach. “The first two weeks are the hardest,” he tells me encouragingly.</p><p>“Two WEEKS?” I want to shriek.</p><p>Hanging out there does not go well. My diary entry that night reads “I sobbed alone and life felt unbearable and I wondered what Cal Newport’s advice is when your digital declutter just uncovers that there is nothing in your life, that you are unwanted and unloved and have no community or connections”.</p><p>It is not a good night.</p><p>On a Thursday night, I think about going to a meetup. I walk to the restaurant, but I don’t see anyone I know inside, and I don’t go in. I sit on a bench nearby for half an hour, just watching people go back and forth, averting my eyes so meetup-goers won’t recognize me. A bus goes by. Three minutes later, a woman around my age sees me sitting on the bench. “Excuse me,” she says, “do you know if the bus went by yet?”</p><p>“Yeah, it did,” I tell her. “Sorry!”</p><p>“Oh, thanks!”</p><p>I’m ecstatic with the interaction, giddy. A person talked to me! I helped her!</p><p>I wander away from the bench, but I don’t want to go home yet. I usually avoid the busier, more commercial streets when I’m out walking, but today I’m drawn to them — I need to hear voices, I need things to look at, lights and colors and things that move.</p><p>I go into the Trader Joe’s on the corner of my block, just because it’s bright inside and full of people. An older man asks an older woman if she knows where the coffee is. This is something I will notice repeatedly and starkly: that only older people talk to strangers, and they seem to have learned that young people don’t want to be asked for things. Is this a post-pandemic thing? In 2019 at this same Trader Joe’s I asked a guy my age to reach something off a high shelf for me and he was happy to oblige.</p><p>In any case, the older woman does not know where the coffee is.</p><p>“Hi,” I stick my head into the conversation. “The coffee’s over there, by the bread.” I point.</p><p>“Oh, thank you!”</p><p>He’s so genuinely delighted. Is this what it could be like to go through the world?</p><p>When I get home my upstairs neighbor is outside, and I talk to him a bit. He’s in his 60s, too. Young people don’t talk to each other.</p><p>A few days later, back at that Trader Joe’s with my Post-it note shopping list in hand, I find that the store doesn’t carry buttermilk, which I need for a recipe. Standing in the long checkout line, I turn to the woman behind me.</p><p>“Do you know what I can substitute for buttermilk in a baking recipe?” I ask her. She’s in her 60s. The man behind her, in his 40s, gets into the conversation, seems happy to offer me solutions.</p><p>I tell a friend about the encounter later and they say that every part of them clenched just to hear about it. They could never imagine doing such a thing, and they have no desire to.</p><p>I hadn’t realized I had any desire to, either.</p><br /><br /><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/eeFqTjmZ8kS7S5tpg/the-first-two-weeks-are-the-hardest-my-first-digital#comments">Discuss</a>

### [Irrationality as a Defense Mechanism for Reward-hacking](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/H8uoAmbeqjD2PG2jm/irrationality-as-a-defense-mechanism-for-reward-hacking)

**来源**: LessWrong - AI

**摘要**: Published on January 18, 2026 3:57 AM GMT<br /><br /><p><i>This post was written as part of research done at MATS 9.0 under the mentorship of Richard Ngo. It's related to my previous </i><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/K4H48fTzLBJj5Fox6/understanding-agency-through-markov-blankets"><i>post</i></a><i>, but should be readable as a standalone</i>.</p><p><i>Remark: I'm not yet familiar enough with the active inference literature to be sure that the issues I bring up haven't been addressed or discussed. If you think my characterisation of the state and flaws of the theory are missing something substantial, I'd love to know.</i></p><h2>Introduction</h2><p>In the theory of active inference, agents are described as having a set of internal states that interact with external states (the world) through a membrane of intermediate states, such as the senses. I'm currently exploring how agents are able to exhibit approximations of external reference that allow them to stay alive in the real world. They achieve this even though they only have access to the statistical proxy of their internals, which they could easily reward-hack without optimising the external states at all.</p><p>One of active inference's weaknesses is that it struggles to model agents' uncertainties about their own preferences. I here propose a potential explanation for why agents are conflicted about these preferences. This perspective posits agents' seeming inconsistency and irrationality about their goals as a mechanism that protects them from reward-hacking their internal states.&nbsp;</p><h2>Internal reward-hacking</h2><p>Consider the following question:</p><blockquote><p>What stops an agent from generating adversarial fulfilment criteria for its goals that are easier to satisfy than the "real", external goals?</p></blockquote><p>Take Clippy as an example, whose goal is stated as maximising the amount of paperclips in the world. Since Clippy only has internal reference, it could represent this goal as "I observe that the world has as many paperclips as it could possibly have". I'm wondering what in Clippy's system saves it from "winning at life" by hooking its sensors up to a cheap simulator that generates an infinite stream of fictional paperclips for it to observe.</p><h2>Do agents just have good priors?</h2><p>An elegant answer to the problem of internal reward-hacking is that agents come pre-equipped with suitable priors about their internal states. In active inference, agents seek to update their beliefs and act on the world such that their observations fit their priors as closely as possible. The space of "good" priors for agents' internal states is very small. However, evolutionary pressures have selected for agents with priors that are conducive to their survival. According to active inference, agents attempt to manifest these favourable priors through action, which makes the priors function as preferences.</p><p>Unfortunately, the claim that evolutionarily fine-tuned priors do all the work to prevent internal reward-hacking seems lacking to me, because in practice we are uncertain about our own feelings and preferences. We don't actually have locked-in, invariant preferences, and it's unclear to me how active inference explains this; preferences are usually encoded as priors over observations, but ironically these are never updated.<span class="footnote-reference" id="fnref5liri3yt9cl"><sup><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/feed.xml?view=community-rss&amp;karmaThreshold=30#fn5liri3yt9cl">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><p>Active inference thus implicitly assumes agents to be consistently, definitively settled on their preferences. Agents are only uncertain about the external states and about how their actions and senses will interact with those states. Within those unknowns, they seek to optimise for the observations that they are certain they prefer. I don't think this assumption is warranted. In fact, I have been considering the possibility that agents' uncertainty about their own preferences is an important instrument for increasing their (bounded) rationality.</p><h2>Internal inconsistency as a tool for rationality</h2><p>Consider the example I used in my last <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/K4H48fTzLBJj5Fox6/understanding-agency-through-markov-blankets">post </a>of a hypothetical person, Alice, who wants to maximise "success". In that example, Alice avoids applying to a prestigious university because rejection would decrease her internal perception of success. She instead applies to a worse university that she is sure to get into, as this will certainly increase her success-o-meter.&nbsp;</p><p>Suppose instead that Alice feels a twinge of guilt not applying to the prestigious university, as this could be perceived as "loser" behaviour by her friend. This guilt may motivate her to apply anyway, even though the action lowers (in expectation) her internal perception of success. Here, the mixed optimisation of two distinct goals: "I perceive myself as maximally successful" and "I perceive myself as someone that my friend thinks is maximally successful", yields behaviour that <i>actually makes</i> Alice more successful.</p><p>In Free Energy Minimisers (FEMs) from active inference, preferences are usually described as fixed priors over the space of observations. One possible model for Alice's behaviour is that each action is chosen with respect to one of two sets of priors. The priors she chooses to satisfy in a given action are sampled from some distribution over priors that represents the degree to which she identifies with conflicting preferences. In practice, Alice now doesn't resemble a consistent FEM, but she has become <i>more</i> aligned with respect to the external goal. Her mixed strategy between preferences can be seen as hedging against her top choice of priors being unfit.</p><h2>What's next: competition between preferences</h2><p>I would like to distinguish this concept of inconsistent preferences from mental motions such as compartmentalisation. For instance, suppose an agent learns to calculate the derivative of a function (f+g) by having separate<span class="footnote-reference" id="fnref36y1awqf31k"><sup><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/feed.xml?view=community-rss&amp;karmaThreshold=30#fn36y1awqf31k">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;parts of itself calculate the derivatives of f and g and then adding the results. This motion could be seen as the agent using subagents' outputs to solve a problem. However, these "subagents" are not imbued with goals of their own. They're more like tools that the agent deploys to break the problem down into manageable components.</p><p>My guess is that people's uncertainties about their preferences are better represented as meme(plexe)s competing with each other for attention. The memes that live to be observed in minds are those that could be seen as agentically pursuing survival and reproduction.<span class="footnote-reference" id="fnrefksg5ayavons"><sup><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/feed.xml?view=community-rss&amp;karmaThreshold=30#fnksg5ayavons">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Internal preferential inconsistency would thus be analogous to the sub-parts in the above example optimising to convince the agent that they are "useful" for calculating derivatives and should be kept around.<span class="footnote-reference" id="fnrefj4uiylte34"><sup><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/feed.xml?view=community-rss&amp;karmaThreshold=30#fnj4uiylte34">[4]</a></sup></span></p><p>Sub-processes and compartmentalisation as tools to increase rationality are not controversial ideas. The more contentious claim I'm ideating is that even conflicting agentic sub-processes — harboring goals that are unaligned with those of the larger agent — can <i>still</i> be useful for increasing agentic rationality with respect to external goals. I aim to formalise and explore this hypothesis in an empirical or mathematised setting.</p><ol class="footnote-section footnotes"><li class="footnote-item" id="fn5liri3yt9cl"><span class="footnote-back-link"><sup><strong><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/feed.xml?view=community-rss&amp;karmaThreshold=30#fnref5liri3yt9cl">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class="footnote-content"><p>There's a good reason for never updating priors over observations. If agents' preferences could update, they would gradually move towards preferring states that are more likely, even if these aren't fruitful for their continued existence. The function of the fixed priors is to give agents a vision of the world they are willing to execute actions to manifest; these are preferences.</p></div></li><li class="footnote-item" id="fn36y1awqf31k"><span class="footnote-back-link"><sup><strong><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/feed.xml?view=community-rss&amp;karmaThreshold=30#fnref36y1awqf31k">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class="footnote-content"><p>this potentially includes separation across time</p></div></li><li class="footnote-item" id="fnksg5ayavons"><span class="footnote-back-link"><sup><strong><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/feed.xml?view=community-rss&amp;karmaThreshold=30#fnrefksg5ayavons">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class="footnote-content"><p>For example, successful memes, like catchy songs, have a tendency to get their hosts to spread them to other people.</p></div></li><li class="footnote-item" id="fnj4uiylte34"><span class="footnote-back-link"><sup><strong><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/feed.xml?view=community-rss&amp;karmaThreshold=30#fnrefj4uiylte34">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class="footnote-content"><p>This goal could functionally be the same as actually being good at calculating derivatives, but it doesn't have to be. For example, if the agent wants the derivative to be high, then a sub-part may gain a competitive advantage by overestimating the answer of the derivative of f. It may eventually convince the agent to employ two copies of itself to calculate the derivatives of both f and g, replacing the other sub-part.</p></div></li></ol><br /><br /><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/H8uoAmbeqjD2PG2jm/irrationality-as-a-defense-mechanism-for-reward-hacking#comments">Discuss</a>

### [Understanding Trust: Project Update](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/yig4LeEfpkFfiWpk2/understanding-trust-project-update)

**来源**: LessWrong - AI

**摘要**: Published on January 17, 2026 9:19 PM GMT<br /><br /><p>This is a brief note on what I did with my funding in 2025, and my plans for 2026, written primarily because Manifund nudged me for an update on <a href="https://manifund.org/projects/understanding-trust">my project</a>.</p><p>I ran my AISC project (which I announced <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7AzexLYpXKMqevttN/seeking-collaborators">here</a>) with four mentees in Spring 2025: Norman Hsia, Hanna Gabor, Paul Rapoport, and Roman Malov. A few other people attended the weekly meetings as well, and those regular meetings have continued (they are joinable -- pm me if interested). Norman and Paul ended up as coauthors of my <a href="https://www.iliadconference.com/proceedings">ILIAD 2024</a> paper <a href="https://www.iliadconference.com/s/Understanding_Trust-Abram-Demski.pdf"><i>Understanding Trust</i></a><i>,</i> which had been drafted in 2024, so served as both an input and an output of the AISC project.</p><p>I recorded most of the meetings involved in the project, as one of the hopeful outputs was publicly posted videos explaining the research agenda. I've proven to be bad at this side of things: I don't like listening to myself talk, so I found it difficult to edit or even to review edits done by others. I'm finally uploading the videos with minimal AI-orchestrated edits. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@AbramDemski/playlists">Playlist here</a>. At the time of publication, there's only two, but more coming very soon. If you are OK with the almost-unedited presentation style, it should be a good resource to get a very in-depth view on my thinking about AI safety and decision theory; a thorough snapshot of my thinking as of spring 2025.</p><p>In 2025, I obtained funding for 2025 as well as 2026. (My total financial runway is longer than this, but 2025 and 2026 have been funded by grants/donations which compensated me for my continued research at specific price points.) I'm opening up <a href="https://manifund.org/projects/understanding-trust">my Manifund project</a> for funding for 2027, for those who feel so inclined.</p><p>In addition to publishing the ILIAD 2024 paper, I also published an ILIAD 2025 paper: <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=Rf1CeGPA22"><i>Communication &amp; Trust</i></a>. I consider it to be an incremental improvement: the ILIAD 2024 treated self-modifying actions as a distinct class with known effects which work with certainty. The ILIAD 2025 paper treated all actions as having some subjective chance of disrupting the agent's computation.&nbsp;</p><p>I also attended Inkhaven, where I wrote a post for every day in November. This was a big success for me: I was able to write about many things which I had been wanting to write about for some time (perhaps in rougher form than if I had eventually gotten around to them via my normal writing process). It was also exhausting. <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/aY9ADGuvAmguLDFgP/inkhaven-retrospective-1">Here's my retrospective</a>, with the caveat that I wrote it on the very last day, when I was perhaps the most sick of writing.</p><p>One of the posts describes <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/4gosqCbFhtLGPojMX/research-reflections">my research arc over 2025, and the hopes I have moving forward</a>. This is still a good summary of where I'd like to take my research in 2026. I have hope that we're understanding concepts and abstraction better, so that we might soon be able to characterize important concepts like agency, alignment, corrigibility, etc in a formalism which deals natively with ontological shifts. Most of my hope is due to Sam Eisenstat's <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=HwKFJ3odui"><i>Condensation: a theory of concepts</i></a>, <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/BstHXPgQyfeNnLjjp/condensation">which I wrote a detailed review of during Inkhaven</a>.</p><p>As for my more ML-flavored research ideas, I finally <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/K3aPmF5o37pYDqrFQ/taking-llms-seriously-as-language-models">wrote about that stuff last week</a>. I've already found someone interested in trying some experiments based on those ideas. We'll see how that goes.</p><p>I'm also mentoring with MATS this summer. You can still <a href="https://www.matsprogram.org/program/summer-2026">apply to my MATS track</a> <i>today or tomorrow</i> as I write this; applications are due January 18th.</p><br /><br /><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/yig4LeEfpkFfiWpk2/understanding-trust-project-update#comments">Discuss</a>

### [Forfeiting Ill-Gotten Gains](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/pyuhYvkqX9Lzr6QWX/forfeiting-ill-gotten-gains)

**来源**: LessWrong - AI

**摘要**: Published on January 17, 2026 12:20 AM GMT<br /><br /><p><span>

It's a holiday.  The cousins are over, and the kids are having a great
time.  Unfortunately, that includes rampaging through the kitchen.
We're trying to cook, so there's a "no cutting through the kitchen"
rule.  Imagine enforcement looks like:

</span>

</p><p>

</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Kid: [dashes into kitchen, pursued by cousin]<br />
Adult: Out of the kitchen!<br />
Kid: Sorry! [Continues their path, leaving through the other door; escapes
pursuit from more rule-abiding cousin]
</p>
</blockquote>



<p>

This doesn't work!  The kid got what they wanted out of this interaction, and
isn't going to change their behavior.  Instead, I need to make it be not worth
their while:

</p>

<p>

</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Kid: [dashes into kitchen, pursued by cousin]<br />
Adult: No cutting through the kitchen! [Physically rebuffs intruder]!<br />
Kid: Sorry! [Forced to leave through the door they entered by; caught by cousin.]
</p>
</blockquote>



<p>

Other examples:

</p>

<p>

</p>

<ul>

<li><p>Sneak candy, spit it out and forfeit dessert.
</p></li>
<li><p>Use sibling's tablet time, lose your own.
</p></li>
<li><p>Interrupt, be ignored.

</p></li>
</ul>



<p>

The general principle is that if you want to limit behavior the
combination of the gains from rule-breaking and penalty from
punishment need to put the kid in a worse position than if they'd
never broken the rule.

</p>

<p>

This isn't just a parenting thing: it's common to say that "crime
should not pay", and many legal systems prohibit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restitution_and_unjust_enrichment">unjust
enrichment</a>.  One place I'd like to see this implemented is
airplane evacuation.  If the safety announcements included "In the
event of an emergency evacuation, any carry-on luggage you bring will
be confiscated and destroyed. You will also be fined." we would have
more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Haneda_Airport_runway_collision">JAL
516</a> (379 occupants, zero deaths) and less <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeroflot_Flight_1492#Evacuation_with_luggage">Aeroflot
1492</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emirates_Flight_521#Flight">Emirates
521</a>.

### [Stop Picking Sides: Manage the Tension Between Adaptation and                Optimization](https://martinfowler.com/articles/stop-picking-sides.html)

**来源**: Martin Fowler

**摘要**: <div class="img-link"><a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/stop-picking-sides.html"><img src="https://martinfowler.com/articles/stop-picking-sides/infograph.jpg" width="" /></a></div>

<p><b class="author">Jim Highsmith</b> notes that many teams have turned into
      tribes wedded to exclusively adaptation or optimization. But he feels this
      misses the point that both of these are important, and we need to manage
      the tension between them. We can do this by thinking of two operating
      modes: explore (adaptation-dominant) and exploit (optimization dominant).
      We tailor a team's operating model to a particular blend of the two -
      considering uncertainty, risk, cost of change, and an evidence threshold.
      We should be particularly careful at the points where there is a handoff
      between the two modes</p>

### [Fragments: January  8](https://martinfowler.com/fragments/2026-01-08.html)

**来源**: Martin Fowler

**摘要**: <p>Anthropic report on <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/how-ai-is-transforming-work-at-anthropic">how their AI is changing their own software development practice</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Most usage is for debugging and helping understand existing code</li>
  <li>Notable increase in using it for implementing new features</li>
  <li>Developers using it for 59% of their work and getting 50% productivity increase</li>
  <li>14% of developers are “power users” reporting much greater gains</li>
  <li>Claude helps developers to work outside their core area</li>
  <li>Concerns about changes to the profession, career evolution, and social dynamics</li>
</ul>

<p> ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p>Much of the discussion about using LLMs for software development lacks details on workflow. Rather than just hear people gush about how wonderful it is, I want to understand the gritty details. What kinds of interactions occur with the LLM? What decisions do the humans make? When reviewing LLM outputs, what kinds of things are the humans looking for, what corrections do they make?</p>

<p><a href="https://obie.medium.com/what-used-to-take-months-now-takes-days-cc8883cc21e9">Obie Fernandez</a> has written a post that goes into these kinds of details. Over the Christmas / New Year period he used Claude to build a knowledge distillation application, that takes transcripts from Claude Code sessions, slack discussion, github PR threads etc, turns them into an RDF graph database, and provides a web app with natural language ways to query them.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Not a proof of concept. Not a demo. The first cut of Nexus, a production-ready system with authentication, semantic search, an MCP server for agent access, webhook integrations for our primary SaaS platforms, comprehensive test coverage, deployed, integrated and ready for full-scale adoption at my company this coming Monday. Nearly 13,000 lines of code.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The article is long, but worth the time to read it.</p>

<p>An important feature of his workflow is relying on <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestDrivenDevelopment.html">Test-Driven Development</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here’s what made this sustainable rather than chaotic: TDD. Test-driven development. For most of the features, I insisted that Claude Code follow the red-green-refactor cycle with me. Write a failing test first. Make it pass with the simplest implementation. Then refactor while keeping tests green.</p>

  <p>This wasn’t just methodology purism. TDD served a critical function in AI-assisted development: it kept me in the loop. When you’re directing thousands of lines of code generation, you need a forcing function that makes you actually understand what’s being built. Tests are that forcing function. You can’t write a meaningful test for something you don’t understand. And you can’t verify that a test correctly captures intent without understanding the intent yourself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The account includes a major refactoring, and much evolution of the initial version of the tool. It’s also an interesting glimpse of how AI tooling may finally make RDF useful.</p>

<p> ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p>When thinking about requirements for software, most discussions focus on prioritization. Some folks talk about buckets such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method">MoSCoW set</a>: Must, Should, Could, and Want. (The old joke being that, in MoSCoW, the cow is silent, because hardly any requirements end up in those buckets.) <a href="https://world.hey.com/jason/the-obvious-the-easy-and-the-possible-2e11a3fb">Jason Fried</a> has a different set of buckets for interface design: <strong>Obvious, Easy, and Possible</strong>. This immediately resonates with me: a good way of think about how to allocate the cognitive costs for those who use a tool.</p>

<p> ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p><a href="https://www.platformer.news/fake-uber-eats-whisleblower-hoax-debunked/">Casey Newton</a> explains how he followed up on an interesting story of dark patterns in food delivery, and found it to be a fake story, buttressed by AI image and document creation. On one hand, it clarifies the important role reporters play in exposing lies that get traction on the internet. But time taken to do this is time not spent on investigating real stories</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For most of my career up until this point, the document shared with me by the whistleblower would have seemed highly credible in large part because it would have taken so long to put together. Who would take the time to put together a detailed, 18-page technical document about market dynamics just to troll a reporter? Who would go to the trouble of creating a fake badge?</p>

  <p>Today, though, the report can be generated within minutes, and the badge within seconds. And while no good reporter would ever have published a story based on a single document and an unknown source, plenty would take the time to investigate the document’s contents and see whether human sources would back it up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The internet has always been full of slop, and we have always needed to be wary of what we read there. AI now makes it easy to manufacture convincing looking evidence, and this is never more dangerous than when it confirms strongly held beliefs and fears.</p>

<p> ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7413956151144542208/">Kent Beck</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The descriptions of Spec-Driven development that I have seen emphasize writing the whole specification before implementation. This encodes the (to me bizarre) assumption that you aren’t going to learn anything during implementation that would change the specification.
I’ve heard this story so many times told so many ways by well-meaning folks–if only we could get the specification “right”, the rest of this would be easy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Like him, that story has been the constant background siren to my career in tech. But the <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/llm-learning-loop.html">learning loop</a> of experimentation is essential to the model building that’s at the heart of any kind of worthwhile specification. As <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/llm-learning-loop.html">Unmesh puts it:</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Large Language Models give us great leverage—but they only work if we focus on learning and understanding. They make it easier to explore ideas, to set things up, to translate intent into code across many specialized languages. But the real capability—our ability to respond to change—comes not from how fast we can produce code, but from how deeply we understand the system we are shaping.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When Kent defined Extreme Programming, he made <em>feedback</em> one of its four core values. It strikes me that the key to making the full use of AI in software development is how to use it to accelerate the feedback loops.</p>

<p> ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p>As I listen to people who are serious with AI-assisted programming, the crucial thing I hear is managing context. Programming-oriented tools are geting more sophisticated for that, but there’s also efforts at providing simpler tools, that allow customization. <a href="https://lixo.org">Carlos Villela</a> recently recommended Pi, and its developer, <a href="https://mariozechner.at/posts/2025-11-30-pi-coding-agent/">Mario Zechner, has an interesting blog</a> on its development.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So what’s an old guy yelling at Claudes going to do? He’s going to write his own coding agent harness and give it a name that’s entirely un-Google-able, so there will never be any users. Which means there will also never be any issues on the GitHub issue tracker. How hard can it be?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If I ever get the time to sit and really play with these tools, then something like Pi would be something I’d like to try out. Although as an addict to The One True Editor, I’m interested in some of libraries that work with that, such as <a href="https://github.com/karthink/gptel">gptel</a>. That would enable me to use Emacs’s inherent programability to create my own command set to drive the interaction with LLMs.</p>

<p> ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p>Outside of my professional work, I’ve <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/blog/13064/martins-7th-decade">posting regularly about my boardgaming</a> on the specialist site BoardGameGeek. However its blogging environment doesn’t do a good job of providing an index to my posts, so I’ve created <a href="https://martinfowler.com/boardgames/">a list of my BGG posts </a> on my own site.

**摘要**: <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gitanjalivenkatraman/">Gitanjali Venkatraman</a> does wonderful illustrations of complex subjects (which is why I was so happy to work with her on our <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/expert-generalist.html">Expert Generalists</a> article). She has now published the latest in her series of illustrated guides: tackling the complex topic of <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/content/dam/thoughtworks/documents/blog/mainframe_modernisation_illustrated_guide_2025.pdf">Mainframe Modernization</a></p>

<p>In it she illustrates the history and value of mainframes, why modernization is so tricky, and how to tackle the problem by breaking it down into tractable pieces. I love the clarity of her explanations, and smile frequently at her way of enhancing her words with her quirky pictures.</p>

<p> ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p>Gergely Orosz on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gergely.pragmaticengineer.com/post/3m7xd33hi5c2d">social media</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unpopular opinion:</p>

  <p>Current code review tools just don’t make much sense for AI-generated code</p>

  <p>When reviewing code I really want to know:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The prompt made by the dev</li>
    <li>What corrections the other dev made to the code</li>
    <li>Clear marking of code AI-generated not changed by a human</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Some people pushed back saying they don’t (and shouldn’t care) whether it was written by a human, generated by an LLM, or copy-pasted from Stack Overflow.</p>

<p>In my view it matters <em>a lot</em> - because of the second vital purpose of code review.</p>

<p>When asked why do code reviews, most people will answer the first vital purpose - quality control. We want to ensure bad code gets blocked before it hits <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/branching-patterns.html#mainline">mainline</a>. We do this to avoid bugs and to avoid other quality issues, in particular comprehensibility and ease of change.</p>

<p>But I hear the second vital purpose less often: code review is a mechanism to communicate and educate. If I’m submitting some sub-standard code, and it gets rejected, I want to know why so that I can improve my programming. Maybe I’m unaware of some library features, or maybe there’s some project-specific standards I haven’t run into yet, or maybe my naming isn’t as clear as I thought it was. Whatever the reasons, I need to know in order to learn. And my employer needs me to learn, so I can be more effective.</p>

<p>We need to know the writer of the code we review both so we can communicate our better practice to them, but also to know how to improve things. With a human, its a conversation, and perhaps some documentation if we realize we’ve needed to explain things repeatedly. But with an LLM it’s about how to modify its context, as well as humans learning how to better drive the LLM.</p>

<p> ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p>Wondering why I’ve been making a lot of posts like this recently? <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/writing-fragments.html">I explain why</a> I’ve been reviving the link blog.</p>

<p> ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p><a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/10/html-tools/">Simon Willison</a> describes how he uses LLMs to build disposable but useful web apps</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>These are the characteristics I have found to be most productive in building tools of this nature:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>A single file: inline JavaScript and CSS in a single HTML file means the least hassle in hosting or distributing them, and crucially means you can copy and paste them out of an LLM response.</li>
    <li>Avoid React, or anything with a build step. The problem with React is that JSX requires a build step, which makes everything massively less convenient. I prompt “no react” and skip that whole rabbit hole entirely.</li>
    <li>Load dependencies from a CDN. The fewer dependencies the better, but if there’s a well known library that helps solve a problem I’m happy to load it from CDNjs or jsdelivr or similar.</li>
    <li>Keep them small. A few hundred lines means the maintainability of the code doesn’t matter too much: any good LLM can read them and understand what they’re doing, and rewriting them from scratch with help from an LLM takes just a few minutes.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>His repository includes all these tools, together with transcripts of the chats that got the LLMs to build them.</p>

<p> ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p><a href="https://obie.medium.com/what-happens-when-the-coding-becomes-the-least-interesting-part-of-the-work-ab10c213c660">Obie Fernandez</a>: while many engineers are underwhelmed by AI tools, some senior engineers are finding them really valuable. He feels that senior engineers have an oft-unspoken mindset, which in conjunction with an LLM, enables the LLM to be much more valuable.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Levels of abstraction and generalization problems get talked about a lot because they’re easy to name. But they’re far from the whole story.</p>

  <p>Other tools show up just as often in real work:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>A sense for blast radius. Knowing which changes are safe to make loudly and which should be quiet and contained.</li>
    <li>A feel for sequencing. Knowing when a technically correct change is still wrong because the system or the team isn’t ready for it yet.</li>
    <li>An instinct for reversibility. Preferring moves that keep options open, even if they look less elegant in the moment.</li>
    <li>An awareness of social cost. Recognizing when a clever solution will confuse more people than it helps.</li>
    <li>An allergy to false confidence. Spotting places where tests are green but the model is wrong.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p> ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p><a href="https://friendlybit.com/python/writing-justhtml-with-coding-agents/">Emil Stenström</a> built an HTML5 parser in python using coding agents, using Github Copilot in Agent mode with Claude Sonnet 3.7. He automatically approved most commands. It took him “a couple of months on off-hours”, including at least one restart from scratch. The parser now passes all the tests in html5lib test suite.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After writing the parser, I still don’t know HTML5 properly. The agent wrote it for me. I guided it when it came to API design and corrected bad decisions at the high level, but it did ALL of the gruntwork and wrote all of the code.</p>

  <p>I handled all git commits myself, reviewing code as it went in. I didn’t understand all the algorithmic choices, but I understood when it didn’t do the right thing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although he gives an overview of what happens, there’s not very much information on his workflow and how he interacted with the LLM. There’s certainly not enough detail here to try to replicate his approach. This is contrast to Simon Willison (above) who has detailed links to his chat transcripts - although they are much smaller tools and I haven’t looked at them properly to see how useful they are.</p>

<p>One thing that is clear, however, is the vital need for a comprehensive test suite. Much of his work is driven by having that suite as a clear guide for him and the LLM agents.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>JustHTML is about 3,000 lines of Python with 8,500+ tests passing. I couldn’t have written it this quickly without the agent.</p>

  <p>But “quickly” doesn’t mean “without thinking.” I spent a lot of time reviewing code, making design decisions, and steering the agent in the right direction. The agent did the typing; I did the thinking.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>                                  ❄                                  ❄    </p>

<p>Then Simon Willison <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/15/porting-justhtml/">ported the library to JavaScript</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Time elapsed from project idea to finished library: about 4 hours, during which I also bought and decorated a Christmas tree with family and watched the latest Knives Out movie.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of his lessons:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you can reduce a problem to a robust test suite you can set a coding agent loop loose on it with a high degree of confidence that it will eventually succeed. I called this <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/30/designing-agentic-loops/">designing the agentic loop</a> a few months ago. I think it’s the key skill to unlocking the potential of LLMs for complex tasks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Our experience at Thoughtworks backs this up. We’ve been doing a fair bit of work recently in legacy modernization (mainframe and otherwise) using AI to migrate substantial software systems. Having a robust test suite is necessary (but not sufficient) to making this work. I hope to share my colleagues’ experiences on this in the coming months.</p>

<p>But before I leave Willison’s post, I should highlight his final open questions on the legalities, ethics, and effectiveness of all this - they are well-worth contemplating.</p>

### [Writing Fragments](https://martinfowler.com/articles/writing-fragments.html)

**来源**: Martin Fowler

**摘要**: <p>If you’re a regular reader of my site, you’ll have noticed that in the
last few months I’ve been making a <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/20251204-frags.html">number</a> of “fragments” <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/2025-11-19-frags.html">posts</a>. Such a post
is a short post with a bunch of little, unconnected segments. These are
usually a reference to something I’ve found on the web, sometimes a small
thought of my own.</p>

<p>A few years ago, I wouldn’t have covered these topics with posts on my
own site. Instead I would use Twitter, either retweeting someone else’s
point, or just highlighting something I’d found. But since the Muskover,
Twitter has effectively died. I’m not saying that due to any technical
issues with the site, which has mostly just been fine, nor directly due to
any of the policy changes there. The point is that lots of people have left, so that
the audience I would have reached with Twitter is now fragmented. Some
remain on X, but I see more activity on LinkedIn. There’s also Fediverse/Mastodon
and Bluesky.</p>

<p>What this means for short posts is that I can no longer just post in one
place. When I announce new articles on martinfowler.com, I announce now on
four social media sites (X, LinkedIn, Fediverse, and Bluesky). It makes
sense to do this, but I don’t want to go through all this hassle for the
kind of micro-post that Twitter served so well.</p>

<p>So I’ve started to batch them up. When I see something interesting, I
make a note. When I have enough notes, I post a fragments post. Initially I
did this in a rather ad-hoc way, just using the same mechanisms I use for
most articles, but last week I started to put in some more deliberate
mechanisms into the site. (If you’re observant, you’ll spot that in the URLs.)</p>

<p>One benefit of all of this, at least in my book, is that it means my material is
now fully visible in RSS. I’m probably showing my age, but I’m a big fan of RSS
(or in my case, strictly Atom) feeds. I miss the feel of the heyday of the
“blogosphere” before it got steamrolled by social media, and these fragment
posts are, of course, just the same as the link blogs from that era. I still use my
RSS reader every day to keep up with writers I like. (I’m pleased that Substack
makes its content available via RSS.) It bothered me a bit that my micro-founts
of Twitter knowledge weren’t visible on RSS, but was too lazy to do something
about it. Now I don’t need to - the fragments are available in my RSS feed.</p>

  <p>There are three charges against X, which all stem from a multi-year investigation that was launched in 2023.

These charges have nothing to do with what content is on X, or what user speech the platform should or should not allow.</p>

**摘要**: <p><a href="https://blog.robbowley.net/2025/12/04/ai-is-still-making-code-worse-a-new-cmu-study-confirms/">Rob Bowley</a> summarizes a study from Carnegie Mellon looking on the impact of AI on a bunch of open-source software projects. Like any such study, we shouldn’t take its results as definitive, but there seems enough there to make it a handy data point. The key point is that the AI code probably reduced the quality of the code base - at least if static code analysis can be trusted to determine quality. And perhaps some worrying second-order effects</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This study shows more than 800 popular GitHub projects with code quality degrading after adopting AI tools. It’s hard not to see a form of context collapse playing out in real time. If the public code that future models learn from is becoming more complex and less maintainable, there’s a real risk that newer models will reinforce and amplify those trends, producing even worse code over time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p>Rob’s post is typical of much of the thoughtful writing on AI. We can see its short-term benefits, but worry about its long-term impact. But on a much deeper note is this lovely story from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/my-80th-birthday-i-bought-myself-new-brain-jim-highsmith-8qcrc/">Jim Highsmith</a>. Jim has turned 0x50, and has spent the last decade fighting Parkinson’s disease. To help him battle it he has two AI assisted allies.</p>

<p><strong>If you read anything on AI this week, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/my-80th-birthday-i-bought-myself-new-brain-jim-highsmith-8qcrc/">make it be this</a>.</strong> It offers a positive harbinger for our future and opens my mind to a whole different perspective of the role of AI in it</p>

<p>Anthropic recently announced that it disrupted a Chinese state-sponsored operation abusing Claude Code. Jim Gumbley looks at the core lesson to learn from this, that we have to understand the serious risk of  <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/security/anthropic-ai-espionage-disclosure-signal-from-noise?utm_source=linkedin&amp;utm_medium=social-organic&amp;utm_campaign=dt_bs_rp-in-clt_tech_thought_leaders_2025-11&amp;gh_src=d1fe17bc1us">AI Jailbreaking</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>New AI tools are able to analyze your attack surface at the next level of granularity. As a business leader, that means you now have two options: wait for someone else to run AI-assisted vulnerability detection against your attack surface, or run it yourself first.</p>

<p> ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p>There’s plenty of claims that AI Vibe Coding can replace software developers, something that folks like me (perhaps with a bias) think unlikely. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gergely.pragmaticengineer.com/post/3m75kmb7bh22i">Gergely Orosz</a> shared this tidbit</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Talked with an exec at a tech company who is obsessed with AI and has been for 3 years. Not a developer but company makes software. Uses AI for everything, vibe codes ideas.</p>

  <p>Here’s the kicker:</p>

  <p>Has a team of several devs to implement his vibe coded prototypes to sg workable</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’d love to hear more about this (and similar stories)</p>

<p> ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p><a href="https://checkeagle.com/checklists/njr/a-month-of-chat-oriented-programming/">Nick Radcliffe</a> writes about a month of using AI</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I spent a solid month “pair programming” with Claude Code, trying to suspend disbelief and adopt a this-will-be-productive mindset. More specifically, I got Claude to write well over 99% of the code produced during the month. I found the experience infuriating, unpleasant, and stressful before even worrying about its energy impact. Ideally, I would prefer not to do it again for at least a year or two. The only problem with that is that it “worked”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He stresses that his approach is the “polar opposite” of Vibe Coding. The post is long, and rambles a bit, but is worthwhile because he talks in detail about his workflow and how he uses the tool. Such posts are important so we can learn the nitty-gritty of how our programming habits are changing.</p>

<p> ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p>Along similar lines is a post of <a href="https://brianchambers.substack.com/p/chamber-of-tech-secrets-55-issue">Brian Chambers</a> on his workflow, that he calls Issue-Driven Development (and yes, I’m also sick of the “something-driven” phraseology). As with much of the better stuff I’ve heard about AI assisted work, it’s all about carefully managing the context window, ensuring the AI is focused on the right things and not distracted by textual squirrels.</p>

### [Fragments Nov 19](https://martinfowler.com/articles/2025-11-19-frags.html)

**来源**: Martin Fowler

**摘要**: <p><img alt="radar image" src="https://martinfowler.com/articles/images/frags-2025-11/radar.png" width="300px" /></p>

<p>I’ve been on the road in Europe for the last couple of weeks, and while I was there Thoughtworks released <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar">volume 33 of our Technology Radar</a>. Again it’s dominated by the AI wave, with lots of blips capturing our explorations of how to use LLMs and similar technology. “Agents” are the big thing these days but we’re also seeing growing movements in infrastructure orchestration, coding workflows - and the inevitable antipatterns. Many thanks to my colleagues for putting this together again.</p>

<p>                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p><img alt="Gergely and I recording the podcast" src="https://martinfowler.com/articles/images/frags-2025-11/podcast.png" width="400px" /></p>

<p>My trip to Europe started in Amsterdam, for a Thoughtworks event for a few of our clients there. Since I was in that lovely city, I got in touch with Gergely Orosz, host of <a href="https://www.pragmaticengineer.com/">The Pragmatic Engineer</a>, and he arranged to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQmI4XKTa0U">record a podcast</a> with me. No surprise that AI was front-and-center of the conversation, as I said it was the biggest shift I’d seen in programming during my career, comparable only to the shift to high-level languages, which even I am not old enough to have experienced. It was a fun chat and I really enjoyed myself. Gergely later joined myself James Lewis and Giles Edwards-Alexander at the Thoughtworks event the next day.</p>

<p>                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄</p>

<p>My travels also took me to Nüremberg, where I attended an internal conference for Siemens on the future of software architecture. When we think of technology, it’s easy to focus on the Faangs of Silicon Valley, but Siemens have a huge workforce of software developers working on heavy engineering systems like trains and factory automation. It was good to hear them talk about federated architectures, data mesh, and their use of AI.</p>

### [A data model for Git (and other docs updates)](https://jvns.ca/blog/2026/01/08/a-data-model-for-git/)

**来源**: Julia Evans

**摘要**: <p>Hello! This past fall, I decided to take some time to work on Git&rsquo;s
documentation. I&rsquo;ve been thinking about working on open source docs for a long
time &ndash; usually if I think the documentation for something could be improved,
I&rsquo;ll write a blog post or a zine or something. But this time I wondered: could I
instead make a few improvements to the official documentation?</p>
<p>So <a href="https://marieflanagan.com/">Marie</a> and I made a few changes to the Git
documentation!</p>
<h3 id="a-data-model-for-git">a data model for Git</h3>
<p>After a while working on the documentation, we noticed that Git uses the terms
&ldquo;object&rdquo;, &ldquo;reference&rdquo;, or &ldquo;index&rdquo; in its documentation a lot, but that it didn&rsquo;t
have a great explanation of what those terms mean or how they relate to other
core concepts like &ldquo;commit&rdquo; and &ldquo;branch&rdquo;. So we wrote a new &ldquo;data model&rdquo; document!</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/gitdatamodel.adoc">read the data model here for now</a>.
I assume at some point (after the next release?) it&rsquo;ll also be on the <a href="https://git-scm.com">Git website</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited about this because understanding how Git organizes its commit and
branch data has really helped me reason about how Git works over the years,
and I think it&rsquo;s important to have a short (1600 words!) version of the data
model that&rsquo;s accurate.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;accurate&rdquo; part turned out to not be that easy: I knew the basics of how
Git&rsquo;s data model worked, but during the review process I learned some new
details and had to make quite a few changes (for example how merge conflicts are
stored in the staging area).</p>
<h3 id="updates-to-git-push-git-pull-and-more">updates to <code>git push</code>, <code>git pull</code>, and more</h3>
<p>I also worked on updating the introduction to some of Git&rsquo;s core man pages.
I quickly realized that &ldquo;just try to improve it according to my best judgement&rdquo;
was not going to work: why should the maintainers believe me that my version is
better?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen a problem a lot when discussing open source documentation changes
where 2 expert users of the software argue about whether an explanation
is clear or not (&ldquo;I think X would be a good way to explain it! Well, I think Y
would be better!&rdquo;)</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think this is very productive (expert users of a piece of software
are notoriously bad at being able to tell if an explanation will be clear to
non-experts), so I needed to find a way to identify problems with the man
pages that was a little more evidence-based.</p>
<h3 id="getting-test-readers-to-identify-problems">getting test readers to identify problems</h3>
<p>I asked for test readers on Mastodon to read the current version of
documentation and tell me what they find confusing or what questions they have.
About 80 test readers left comments, and I learned so much!</p>
<p>People left a huge amount of great feedback, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>terminology they didn&rsquo;t understand (what&rsquo;s a pathspec? what does &ldquo;reference&rdquo; mean? does &ldquo;upstream&rdquo; have a specific meaning in Git?)</li>
<li>specific confusing sentences</li>
<li>suggestions of things things to add (&ldquo;I do X all the time, I think it should be included here&rdquo;)</li>
<li>inconsistencies (&ldquo;here it implies X is the default, but elsewhere it implies Y is the default&rdquo;)</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the test readers had been using Git for at least 5-10 years, which
I think worked well &ndash; if a group of test readers who have been using Git
regularly for 5+ years find a sentence or term impossible to understand, it
makes it easy to argue that the documentation should be updated to make it
clearer.</p>
<p>I thought this &ldquo;get users of the software to comment on the existing
documentation and then fix the problems they find&rdquo; pattern worked really
well and I&rsquo;m excited about potentially trying it again in the future.</p>
<h3 id="the-man-page-changes">the man page changes</h3>
<p>We ended updating these 4 man pages:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>git add</code> (<a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/2b3ae040/Documentation/git-add.adoc">before</a>, <a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/e0bfec3dfc356f7d808eb5ee546a54116b794397/Documentation/git-add.adoc">after</a>)</li>
<li><code>git checkout</code> (<a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/2b3ae040/Documentation/git-checkout.adoc">before</a>, <a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/e0bfec3dfc356f7d808eb5ee546a54116b794397/Documentation/git-checkout.adoc">after</a>)</li>
<li><code>git push</code> (<a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/2b3ae040/Documentation/git-push.adoc">before</a>, <a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/e0bfec3dfc356f7d808eb5ee546a54116b794397/Documentation/git-push.adoc">after</a>)</li>
<li><code>git pull</code> (<a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/2b3ae040/Documentation/git-pull.adoc">before</a>, <a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/e0bfec3dfc356f7d808eb5ee546a54116b794397/Documentation/git-pull.adoc">after</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>git push</code> and <code>git pull</code> changes were the most interesting to me: in
addition to updating the intro to those pages, we also ended up writing:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/e0bfec3dfc356f7d808eb5ee546a54116b794397/Documentation/urls-remotes.adoc#upstream-branches">a section describing what the term &ldquo;upstream branch&rdquo; means</a> (which previously wasn&rsquo;t really explained)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/e0bfec3dfc356f7d808eb5ee546a54116b794397/Documentation/git-push.adoc#options">a cleaned-up description of what a &ldquo;push refspec&rdquo; is</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Making those changes really gave me an appreciation for how much work it is
to maintain open source documentation: it&rsquo;s not easy to write things that are
both clear and true, and sometimes we had to make compromises, for example the sentence
&ldquo;<code>git push</code> may fail if you haven’t set an upstream for the current branch,
depending on what <code>push.default</code> is set to.&rdquo; is a little vague, but the exact
details of what &ldquo;depending&rdquo; means are really complicated and untangling that is
a big project.</p>
<h3 id="on-the-process-for-contributing-to-git">on the process for contributing to Git</h3>
<p>It took me a while to understand Git&rsquo;s development process.
I&rsquo;m not going to try to describe it here (that could be a whole other post!), but a few quick notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Git has a <a href="https://git-scm.com/community#discord">Discord server</a>
with a &ldquo;my first contribution&rdquo; channel for help with getting started contributing.
I found people to be very welcoming on the Discord.</li>
<li>I used <a href="https://gitgitgadget.github.io/">GitGitGadget</a> to make all of my contributions.
This meant that I could make a GitHub pull request (a workflow I&rsquo;m comfortable
with) and GitGitGadget would convert my PRs into the system the Git developers
use (emails with patches attached). GitGitGadget worked great and I was very
grateful to not have to learn how to send patches by email with Git.</li>
<li>Otherwise I used my normal email client (Fastmail&rsquo;s web interface) to reply
to emails, wrapping my text to 80 character lines since that&rsquo;s the mailing
list norm.</li>
</ul>
<p>I also found the mailing list archives on <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/git/">lore.kernel.org</a>
hard to navigate, so I hacked together <a href="https://github.com/jvns/git-list-viewer">my own git list viewer</a>
to make it easier to read the long mailing list threads.</p>
<p>Many people helped me navigate the contribution process and review the changes:
thanks to Emily Shaffer, Johannes Schindelin (the author of GitGitGadget),
Patrick Steinhardt, Ben Knoble, Junio Hamano, and more.</p>
<p>(I&rsquo;m experimenting with <a href="https://comments.jvns.ca/post/115861337435768520">comments on Mastodon, you can see the comments here</a>)</p>

### [Notes on switching to Helix from vim](https://jvns.ca/blog/2025/10/10/notes-on-switching-to-helix-from-vim/)

**来源**: Julia Evans

**摘要**: <p>Hello! Earlier this summer I was talking to a friend about how much I
<a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2024/09/12/reasons-i--still--love-fish/">love using fish</a>, and
how I love that I don&rsquo;t have to configure it. They said that they feel the same
way about the <a href="https://helix-editor.com/">helix</a> text editor, and so I decided
to give it a try.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using it for 3 months now and here are a few notes.</p>
<h3 id="why-helix-language-servers">why helix: language servers</h3>
<p>I think what motivated me to try Helix is that I&rsquo;ve been trying to get a working
language server setup (so I can do things like &ldquo;go to definition&rdquo;) and getting
a setup that feels good in Vim or Neovim just felt like too much work.</p>
<p>After using Vim/Neovim for 20 years, I&rsquo;ve tried both &ldquo;build my own custom
configuration from scratch&rdquo; and &ldquo;use someone else&rsquo;s pre-buld configuration
system&rdquo; and even though I love Vim I was excited about having things just work
without having to work on my configuration at all.</p>
<p>Helix comes with built in language server support, and it feels nice
to be able to do things like &ldquo;rename this symbol&rdquo; in any language.</p>
<h3 id="the-search-is-great">the search is great</h3>
<p>One of my favourite things about Helix is the search! If I&rsquo;m searching all the
files in my repository for a string, it lets me scroll through the potential
matching files and see the full context of the match, like this:</p>
<img src="https://jvns.ca/images/helix-search.png" />
<p>For comparison, here&rsquo;s what the vim ripgrep plugin I&rsquo;ve been using looks like:</p>
<img src="https://jvns.ca/images/vim-ripgrep.png" />
<p>There&rsquo;s no context for what else is around that line.</p>
<h3 id="the-quick-reference-is-nice">the quick reference is nice</h3>
<p>One thing I like about Helix is that when I press <code>g</code>, I get a little help popup
telling me places I can go. I really appreciate this because I don&rsquo;t often use
the &ldquo;go to definition&rdquo; or &ldquo;go to reference&rdquo; feature and I often forget the
keyboard shortcut.</p>
<img src="https://jvns.ca/images/goto.png" width="300px" />
<h3 id="some-vim-helix-translations">some vim -&gt; helix translations</h3>
<ul>
<li>Helix doesn&rsquo;t have marks like <code>ma</code>, <code>'a</code>, instead I&rsquo;ve been using <code>Ctrl+O</code> and
<code>Ctrl+I</code> to go back (or forward) to the last cursor location</li>
<li>I think Helix does have macros, but I&rsquo;ve been using multiple cursors in every
case that I would have previously used a macro. I like multiple cursors a lot
more than writing macros all the time. If I want to batch change something in
the document, my workflow is to press <code>%</code> (to highlight everything), then <code>s</code>
to select (with a regex) the things I want to change, then I can just edit
all of them as needed.</li>
<li>Helix doesn&rsquo;t have neovim-style tabs, instead it has a nice buffer switcher (<code>&lt;space&gt;b</code>)
I can use to switch to the buffer I want. There&rsquo;s a
<a href="https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/pull/7109">pull request here</a> to implement neovim-style tabs.
There&rsquo;s also a setting <code>bufferline=&quot;multiple&quot;</code> which can act a bit like tabs
with <code>gp</code>, <code>gn</code> for prev/next &ldquo;tab&rdquo; and <code>:bc</code> to close a &ldquo;tab&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="some-helix-annoyances">some helix annoyances</h3>
<p>Here&rsquo;s everything that&rsquo;s annoyed me about Helix so far.</p>
<ul>
<li>I like the way Helix&rsquo;s <code>:reflow</code> works much less than how
vim reflows text with <code>gq</code>. It doesn&rsquo;t work as well with lists. (<a href="https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/issues/3332">github issue</a>)</li>
<li>If I&rsquo;m making a Markdown list, pressing &ldquo;enter&rdquo; at the end of a list item
won&rsquo;t continue the list. There&rsquo;s a <a href="https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/wiki/Recipes#continue-markdown-lists--quotes">partial workaround</a>
for bulleted lists but I don&rsquo;t know one for numbered lists.</li>
<li>No persistent undo yet: in vim I could use an
<a href="https://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/options.html#'undofile'">undofile</a> so
that I could undo changes even after quitting. Helix doesn&rsquo;t have that feature yet.
(<a href="https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/pull/9154">github PR</a>)</li>
<li>Helix doesn&rsquo;t autoreload files after they change on disk, I have to run
<code>:reload-all</code> (<code>:ra&lt;tab&gt;</code>) to manually reload them. Not a big deal.</li>
<li>Sometimes it crashes, maybe every week or so. I think it might be
<a href="https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/issues/12582">this issue</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The &ldquo;markdown list&rdquo; and reflowing issues come up a lot for me because I spend
a lot of time editing Markdown lists, but I keep using Helix anyway so I guess
they can&rsquo;t be making me that mad.</p>
<h3 id="switching-was-easier-than-i-thought">switching was easier than I thought</h3>
<p>I was worried that relearning 20 years of Vim muscle memory would be really hard.</p>
<p>It turned out to be easier than I expected, I started using Helix on a
vacation for a little low-stakes coding project I was doing on the side and
after a week or two it didn&rsquo;t feel so disorienting anymore. I think it might be
hard to switch back and forth between Vim and Helix, but I haven&rsquo;t needed to use
Vim recently so I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;ll ever become an issue for me.</p>
<p>The first time I tried Helix I tried to force it to use keybindings that were
more similar to Vim and that did not work for me. Just learning the &ldquo;Helix way&rdquo;
was a lot easier.</p>
<p>There are still some things that throw me off: for example <code>w</code> in vim and <code>w</code> in
Helix don&rsquo;t have the same idea of what a &ldquo;word&rdquo; is (the Helix one includes the
space after the word, the Vim one doesn&rsquo;t).</p>
<h3 id="using-a-terminal-based-text-editor">using a terminal-based text editor</h3>
<p>For many years I&rsquo;d mostly been using a GUI version of vim/neovim, so switching
to actually using an editor in the terminal was a bit of an adjustment.</p>
<p>I ended up deciding on:</p>
<ol>
<li>Every project gets its own terminal window, and all of the tabs in that
window (mostly) have the same working directory</li>
<li>I make my Helix tab the first tab in the terminal window</li>
</ol>
<p>It works pretty well, I might actually like it better than my previous workflow.</p>
<h3 id="my-configuration">my configuration</h3>
<p>I appreciate that my configuration is really simple, compared to my neovim
configuration which is hundreds of lines. It&rsquo;s mostly just 4 keyboard
shortcuts.</p>
<pre><code>theme = &quot;solarized_light&quot;
[editor]
# Sync clipboard with system clipboard
default-yank-register = &quot;+&quot;

[keys.normal]
# I didn't like that Ctrl+C was the default &quot;toggle comments&quot; shortcut
&quot;#&quot; = &quot;toggle_comments&quot;

# I didn't feel like learning a different way
# to go to the beginning/end of a line so
# I remapped ^ and $
&quot;^&quot; = &quot;goto_first_nonwhitespace&quot;
&quot;$&quot; = &quot;goto_line_end&quot;

[keys.select]
&quot;^&quot; = &quot;goto_first_nonwhitespace&quot;
&quot;$&quot; = &quot;goto_line_end&quot;

[keys.normal.space]
# I write a lot of text so I need to constantly reflow,
# and missed vim's `gq` shortcut
l = &quot;:reflow&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>There&rsquo;s a separate <code>languages.toml</code> configuration where I set some language
preferences, like turning off autoformatting.
For example, here&rsquo;s my Python configuration:</p>
<pre><code>[[language]]
name = &quot;python&quot;
formatter = { command = &quot;black&quot;, args = [&quot;--stdin-filename&quot;, &quot;%{buffer_name}&quot;, &quot;-&quot;] }
language-servers = [&quot;pyright&quot;]
auto-format = false
</code></pre>
<h3 id="we-ll-see-how-it-goes">we&rsquo;ll see how it goes</h3>
<p>Three months is not that long, and it&rsquo;s possible that I&rsquo;ll decide to go back
to Vim at some point. For example, I wrote a <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/02/28/some-notes-on-using-nix/">post about switching to
nix</a> a while back but
after maybe 8 months I switched back to Homebrew (though I&rsquo;m still using NixOS
to manage one little server, and I&rsquo;m still satisfied with that).</p>

### [New zine: The Secret Rules of the Terminal](https://jvns.ca/blog/2025/06/24/new-zine--the-secret-rules-of-the-terminal/)

**来源**: Julia Evans

**摘要**: <p>Hello! After many months of writing deep dive blog posts about the terminal, on
Tuesday I released a new zine called &ldquo;The Secret Rules of the Terminal&rdquo;!</p>
<p>You can get it for $12 here:
<a href="https://wizardzines.com/zines/terminal">https://wizardzines.com/zines/terminal</a>, or get
an <a href="https://wizardzines.com/zines/all-the-zines/">15-pack of all my zines here</a>.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the cover:</p>

<a href="https://wizardzines.com/zines/terminal/toc.png">
  <img src="https://jvns.ca/images/terminal-toc-small.png" width="600px" />
</a>
<h3 id="why-the-terminal">why the terminal?</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using the terminal every day for 20 years but even though I&rsquo;m very
confident in the terminal, I&rsquo;ve always had a bit of an uneasy feeling about it.
Usually things work fine, but sometimes something goes wrong and it just feels
like investigating it is impossible, or at least like it would open up a huge
can of worms.</p>
<p>So I started trying to write down a list of weird problems I&rsquo;ve run into in terminal and I realized
that the terminal has a lot of tiny inconsistencies like:</p>
<ul>
<li>sometimes you can use the arrow keys to move around, but sometimes pressing the arrow keys just prints <code>^[[D</code></li>
<li>sometimes you can use the mouse to select text, but sometimes you can&rsquo;t</li>
<li>sometimes your commands get saved to a history when you run them, and sometimes they don&rsquo;t</li>
<li>some shells let you use the up arrow to see the previous command, and some don&rsquo;t</li>
</ul>
<p>If you use the terminal daily for 10 or 20 years, even if you don&rsquo;t understand
exactly <em>why</em> these things happen, you&rsquo;ll probably build an intuition for them.</p>
<p>But having an intuition for them isn&rsquo;t the same as understanding why they
happen. When writing this zine I actually had to do a lot of work to figure out
exactly what was <em>happening</em> in the terminal to be able to talk about how to
reason about it.</p>
<h3 id="the-rules-aren-t-written-down-anywhere">the rules aren&rsquo;t written down anywhere</h3>
<p>It turns out that the &ldquo;rules&rdquo; for how the terminal works (how do
you edit a command you type in? how do you quit a program? how do you fix your
colours?) are extremely hard to fully understand, because &ldquo;the terminal&rdquo; is actually
made of many different pieces of software (your terminal emulator, your
operating system, your shell, the core utilities like <code>grep</code>, and every other random
terminal program you&rsquo;ve installed) which are written by different people with different
ideas about how things should work.</p>
<p>So I wanted to write something that would explain:</p>
<ul>
<li>how the 4 pieces of the terminal (your shell, terminal emulator, programs, and TTY driver) fit together to make everything work</li>
<li>some of the core conventions for how you can expect things in your terminal to work</li>
<li>lots of tips and tricks for how to use terminal programs</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="this-zine-explains-the-most-useful-parts-of-terminal-internals">this zine explains the most useful parts of terminal internals</h3>
<p>Terminal internals are a mess. A lot of it is just the way it is because
someone made a decision in the 80s and now it&rsquo;s impossible to change, and
honestly I don&rsquo;t think learning everything about terminal internals is worth
it.</p>
<p>But some parts are not that hard to understand and can really make your
experience in the terminal better, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you understand what <strong>your shell</strong> is responsible for, you can configure your shell (or use a different one!) to access your history more easily, get great tab completion, and so much more</li>
<li>if you understand <strong>escape codes</strong>, it&rsquo;s much less scary when <code>cat</code>ing a binary to stdout messes up your terminal, you can just type <code>reset</code> and move on</li>
<li>if you understand how <strong>colour</strong> works, you can get rid of bad colour contrast in your terminal so you can actually read the text</li>
</ul>

<p>When I wrote <a href="https://wizardzines.com/zines/git">How Git Works</a>, I thought I
knew how Git worked, and I was right. But the terminal is different. Even
though I feel totally confident in the terminal and even though I&rsquo;ve used it
every day for 20 years, I had a lot of misunderstandings about how the terminal
works and (unless you&rsquo;re the author of <code>tmux</code> or something) I think there&rsquo;s a
good chance you do too.</p>
<p>A few things I learned that are actually useful to me:</p>
<ul>
<li>I understand the structure of the terminal better and so I feel more
confident debugging weird terminal stuff that happens to me (I was even able
to suggest a <a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10834">small improvement</a> to fish!). Identifying exactly which piece of software is causing a weird thing to happen in my terminal still isn&rsquo;t <em>easy</em> but I&rsquo;m a lot better at it now.</li>
<li>you can write a shell script to <a href="https://jvns.ca/til/vim-osc52/">copy to your clipboard over SSH</a></li>
<li>how <code>reset</code> works under the hood (it does the equivalent of <code>stty sane; sleep 1; tput reset</code>) – basically I learned that I don&rsquo;t ever need to worry about
remembering <code>stty sane</code> or <code>tput reset</code> and I can just run <code>reset</code> instead</li>
<li>how to look at the invisible escape codes that a program is printing out (run <code>unbuffer program &gt; out; less out</code>)</li>
<li>why the builtin REPLs on my Mac like <code>sqlite3</code> are so annoying to use (they use <code>libedit</code> instead of <code>readline</code>)</li>
</ul>

### [Using `make` to compile C programs (for non-C-programmers)](https://jvns.ca/blog/2025/06/10/how-to-compile-a-c-program/)

**来源**: Julia Evans

**摘要**: <p>I have never been a C programmer but every so often I need to compile a C/C++
program from source. This has been kind of a struggle for me: for a
long time, my approach was basically &ldquo;install the dependencies, run <code>make</code>, if
it doesn&rsquo;t work, either try to find a binary someone has compiled or give up&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope someone else has compiled it&rdquo; worked pretty well when I was running Linux
but since I&rsquo;ve been using a Mac for the last couple of years I&rsquo;ve been running
into more situations where I have to actually compile programs myself.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about what you might have to do to compile a C program! I&rsquo;ll use
a couple of examples of specific C programs I&rsquo;ve compiled and talk about a few
things that can go wrong. Here are three programs we&rsquo;ll be talking about
compiling:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://mj.ucw.cz/sw/paperjam/">paperjam</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.sqlite.org/download.html">sqlite</a></li>
<li><a href="https://git.causal.agency/src/tree/bin/qf.c">qf</a> (a pager you can run to quickly open files from a search with <code>rg -n THING | qf</code>)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-1-install-a-c-compiler">step 1: install a C compiler</h3>
<p>This is pretty simple: on an Ubuntu system if I don&rsquo;t already have a C compiler I&rsquo;ll install one with:</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt-get install build-essential
</code></pre>
<p>This installs <code>gcc</code>, <code>g++</code>, and <code>make</code>. The situation on a Mac is more
confusing but it&rsquo;s something like &ldquo;install xcode command line tools&rdquo;.</p>
<h3 id="step-2-install-the-program-s-dependencies">step 2: install the program&rsquo;s dependencies</h3>
<p>Unlike some newer programming languages, C doesn&rsquo;t have a dependency manager.
So if a program has any dependencies, you need to hunt them down yourself.
Thankfully because of this, C programmers usually keep their dependencies very
minimal and often the dependencies will be available in whatever package manager you&rsquo;re using.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s almost always a section explaining how to get the dependencies in the
README, for example in <a href="https://mj.ucw.cz/sw/paperjam/">paperjam</a>&rsquo;s README, it
says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To compile PaperJam, you need the headers for the libqpdf and libpaper libraries (usually available as libqpdf-dev and libpaper-dev packages).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You may need <code>a2x</code> (found in <a href="http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/a2x.1.html">AsciiDoc</a>) for building manual pages.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So on a Debian-based system you can install the dependencies like this.</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt install -y libqpdf-dev libpaper-dev
</code></pre>
<p>If a README gives a name for a package (like <code>libqpdf-dev</code>), I&rsquo;d basically
always assume that they mean &ldquo;in a Debian-based Linux distro&rdquo;: if you&rsquo;re on a
Mac <code>brew install libqpdf-dev</code> will not work. I still have not 100% gotten
the hang of developing on a Mac yet so I don&rsquo;t have many tips there yet. I
guess in this case it would be <code>brew install qpdf</code> if you&rsquo;re using Homebrew.</p>
<h3 id="step-3-run-configure-if-needed">step 3: run <code>./configure</code> (if needed)</h3>
<p>Some C programs come with a <code>Makefile</code> and some instead come with a script called
<code>./configure</code>. For example, if you download <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/download.html">sqlite&rsquo;s source code</a>, it has a <code>./configure</code> script in
it instead of a Makefile.</p>
<p>My understanding of this <code>./configure</code> script is:</p>
<ol>
<li>You run it, it prints out a lot of somewhat inscrutable output, and then it
either generates a <code>Makefile</code> or fails because you&rsquo;re missing some
dependency</li>
<li>The <code>./configure</code> script is part of a system called
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/Autotools-Introduction.html">autotools</a>
that I have never needed to learn anything about beyond &ldquo;run it to generate
a <code>Makefile</code>&rdquo;.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think there might be some options you can pass to get the <code>./configure</code>
script to produce a different <code>Makefile</code> but I have never done that.</p>
<h3 id="step-4-run-make">step 4: run <code>make</code></h3>
<p>The next step is to run <code>make</code> to try to build a program. Some notes about
<code>make</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes you can run <code>make -j8</code> to parallelize the build and make it go
faster</li>
<li>It usually prints out a million compiler warnings when compiling the program.
I always just ignore them. I didn&rsquo;t write the software! The compiler warnings
are not my problem.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="compiler-errors-are-often-dependency-problems">compiler errors are often dependency problems</h3>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an error I got while compiling <code>paperjam</code> on my Mac:</p>
<pre><code>/opt/homebrew/Cellar/qpdf/12.0.0/include/qpdf/InputSource.hh:85:19: error: function definition does not declare parameters
   85 |     qpdf_offset_t last_offset{0};
      |                   ^
</code></pre>
<p>Over the years I&rsquo;ve learned it&rsquo;s usually best not to overthink problems like
this: if it&rsquo;s talking about <code>qpdf</code>, there&rsquo;s a good change it just means that
I&rsquo;ve done something wrong with how I&rsquo;m including the <code>qpdf</code> dependency.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s talk about some ways to get the <code>qpdf</code> dependency included in the right way.</p>
<h3 id="the-world-s-shortest-introduction-to-the-compiler-and-linker">the world&rsquo;s shortest introduction to the compiler and linker</h3>
<p>Before we talk about how to fix dependency problems: building C programs is split into 2
steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Compiling</strong> the code into <strong>object files</strong> (with <code>gcc</code> or <code>clang</code>)</li>
<li><strong>Linking</strong> those object files into a final binary (with <code>ld</code>)</li>
</ol>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to know this when building a C program because sometimes you
need to pass the right flags to the compiler and linker to tell them where to
find the dependencies for the program you&rsquo;re compiling.</p>
<h3 id="make-uses-environment-variables-to-configure-the-compiler-and-linker"><code>make</code> uses environment variables to configure the compiler and linker</h3>
<p>If I run <code>make</code> on my Mac to install <code>paperjam</code>, I get this error:</p>
<pre><code>c++ -o paperjam paperjam.o pdf-tools.o parse.o cmds.o pdf.o -lqpdf -lpaper
ld: library 'qpdf' not found
</code></pre>
<p>This is not because <code>qpdf</code> is not installed on my system (it actually is!). But
the compiler and linker don&rsquo;t know how to <em>find</em> the <code>qpdf</code> library. To fix this, we need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>pass <code>&quot;-I/opt/homebrew/include&quot;</code> to the compiler (to tell it where to find the header files)</li>
<li>pass <code>&quot;-L/opt/homebrew/lib -liconv&quot;</code> to the linker (to tell it where to find library files and to link in <code>iconv</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>And we can get <code>make</code> to pass those extra parameters to the compiler and linker using environment variables!
To see how this works: inside <code>paperjam</code>&rsquo;s Makefile you can see a bunch of environment variables, like <code>LDLIBS</code> here:</p>
<pre><code>paperjam: $(OBJS)
	$(LD) -o $@ $^ $(LDLIBS)
</code></pre>
<p>Everything you put into the <code>LDLIBS</code> environment variable gets passed to the
linker (<code>ld</code>) as a command line argument.</p>
<h3 id="secret-environment-variable-cppflags">secret environment variable: <code>CPPFLAGS</code></h3>
<p><code>Makefiles</code> sometimes define their own environment variables that they pass to
the compiler/linker, but <code>make</code> also has a bunch of &ldquo;implicit&rdquo; environment
variables which it will automatically pass to the C compiler and linker. There&rsquo;s a <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Implicit-Variables.html#index-CFLAGS0">full list of implicit environment variables here</a>,
but one of them is <code>CPPFLAGS</code>, which gets automatically passed to the C compiler.</p>
<p>(technically it would be more normal to use <code>CXXFLAGS</code> for this, but this
particular <code>Makefile</code> hardcodes <code>CXXFLAGS</code> so setting <code>CPPFLAGS</code> was the only
way I could find to set the compiler flags without editing the <code>Makefile</code>)</p>
<small>
As an aside: it took me a long time to realize how closely tied to C/C++ `make` is -- I used
to think that `make` was just a general build system (and of course you can use it for
anything!) but it has a lot of affordances for building C/C++ programs that it
doesn't have for building any other kind of program.
</small>
<h3 id="two-ways-to-pass-environment-variables-to-make">two ways to pass environment variables to <code>make</code></h3>
<p>I learned thanks to <a href="https://www.owlfolio.org/">@zwol</a> that there are actually two ways to pass environment variables to <code>make</code>:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>CXXFLAGS=xyz make</code> (the usual way)</li>
<li><code>make CXXFLAGS=xyz</code></li>
</ol>
<p>The difference between them is that <code>make CXXFLAGS=xyz</code> will override the
value of <code>CXXFLAGS</code> set in the <code>Makefile</code> but <code>CXXFLAGS=xyz make</code> won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure which way is the norm but I&rsquo;m going to use the first way in this
post.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-use-cppflags-and-ldlibs-to-fix-this-compiler-error">how to use <code>CPPFLAGS</code> and <code>LDLIBS</code> to fix this compiler error</h3>
<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve talked about how <code>CPPFLAGS</code> and <code>LDLIBS</code> get passed to the
compiler and linker, here&rsquo;s the final incantation that I used to get the
program to build successfully!</p>
<pre><code>CPPFLAGS=&quot;-I/opt/homebrew/include&quot; LDLIBS=&quot;-L/opt/homebrew/lib -liconv&quot; make paperjam
</code></pre>
<p>This passes <code>-I/opt/homebrew/include</code> to the compiler and <code>-L/opt/homebrew/lib -liconv</code> to the linker.</p>
<p>Also I don&rsquo;t want to pretend that I &ldquo;magically&rdquo; knew that those were the right
arguments to pass, figuring them out involved a bunch of confused Googling that I
skipped over in this post. I will say that:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <code>-I</code> compiler flag tells the compiler which directory to find header files in, like <code>/opt/homebrew/include/qpdf/QPDF.hh</code></li>
<li>the <code>-L</code> linker flag tells the linker which directory to find libraries in, like <code>/opt/homebrew/lib/libqpdf.a</code></li>
<li>the <code>-l</code> linker flag tells the linker which libraries to link in, like <code>-liconv</code> means &ldquo;link in the <code>iconv</code> library&rdquo;, or <code>-lm</code> means &ldquo;link <code>math</code>&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="tip-how-to-just-build-1-specific-file-make-filename">tip: how to just build 1 specific file: <code>make $FILENAME</code></h3>
<p>Yesterday I discovered this cool tool called
<a href="https://git.causal.agency/src/tree/bin/qf.c">qf</a> which you can use to quickly
open files from the output of <code>ripgrep</code>.</p>
<p><code>qf</code> is in a big directory of various tools, but I only wanted to compile <code>qf</code>.
So I just compiled <code>qf</code>, like this:</p>
<pre><code>make qf
</code></pre>
<p>Basically if you know (or can guess) the output filename of the file you&rsquo;re
trying to build, you can tell <code>make</code> to just build that file by running <code>make $FILENAME</code></p>
<h3 id="tip-you-don-t-need-a-makefile">tip: you don&rsquo;t need a Makefile</h3>
<p>I sometimes write 5-line C programs with no dependencies, and I just learned
that if I have a file called <code>blah.c</code>, I can just compile it like this without creating a <code>Makefile</code>:</p>
<pre><code>make blah
</code></pre>
<p>It gets automaticaly expanded to <code>cc -o blah blah.c</code>, which saves a bit of
typing. I have no idea if I&rsquo;m going to remember this (I might just keep typing
<code>gcc -o blah blah.c</code> anyway) but it seems like a fun trick.</p>
<h3 id="tip-look-at-how-other-packaging-systems-built-the-same-c-program">tip: look at how other packaging systems built the same C program</h3>
<p>If you&rsquo;re having trouble building a C program, maybe other people had problems building it
too! Every Linux distribution has build files for every package that they
build, so even if you can&rsquo;t install packages from that distribution directly,
maybe you can get tips from that Linux distro for how to build the package.
Realizing this (thanks to my friend Dave) was a huge ah-ha moment for me.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/405624e81a9b65378328accb0a11c3e5369e651c/pkgs/by-name/pa/paperjam/package.nix#L35">this line from the nix package for <code>paperjam</code></a> says:</p>
<pre><code>  env.NIX_LDFLAGS = lib.optionalString stdenv.hostPlatform.isDarwin &quot;-liconv&quot;;
</code></pre>
<p>This is basically saying &ldquo;pass the linker flag <code>-liconv</code> to build this on a
Mac&rdquo;, so that&rsquo;s a clue we could use to build it.</p>
<p>That same file also says <code>  env.NIX_CFLAGS_COMPILE = &quot;-DPOINTERHOLDER_TRANSITION=1&quot;;</code>. I&rsquo;m not sure what this means, but when I try
to build the <code>paperjam</code> package I do get an error about something called a
<code>PointerHolder</code>, so I guess that&rsquo;s somehow related to the &ldquo;PointerHolder
transition&rdquo;.</p>
<h3 id="step-5-installing-the-binary">step 5: installing the binary</h3>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve managed to compile the program, probably you want to install it somewhere!
Some <code>Makefile</code>s have an <code>install</code> target that let you install the tool on your
system with <code>make install</code>. I&rsquo;m always a bit scared of this (where is it going
to put the files? what if I want to uninstall them later?), so if I&rsquo;m compiling
a pretty simple program I&rsquo;ll often just manually copy the binary to install it
instead, like this:</p>
<pre><code>cp qf ~/bin
</code></pre>
<h3 id="step-6-maybe-make-your-own-package">step 6: maybe make your own package!</h3>
<p>Once I figured out how to do all of this, I realized that I could use my new
<code>make</code> knowledge to contribute a <code>paperjam</code> package to Homebrew! Then I could
just <code>brew install paperjam</code> on future systems.</p>
<p>The good thing is that even if the details of how all of the different
packaging systems, they fundamentally all use C compilers and linkers.</p>
<h3 id="it-can-be-useful-to-understand-a-little-about-c-even-if-you-re-not-a-c-programmer">it can be useful to understand a little about C even if you&rsquo;re not a C programmer</h3>
<p>I think all of this is an interesting example of how it can useful to
understand some basics of how C programs work (like &ldquo;they have header files&rdquo;)
even if you&rsquo;re never planning to write a nontrivial C program if your life.</p>
<p>It feels good to have some ability to compile C/C++ programs myself, even
though I&rsquo;m still not totally confident about all of the compiler and linker
flags and I still plan to never learn anything about how autotools works other
than &ldquo;you run <code>./configure</code> to generate the <code>Makefile</code>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Two things I left out of this post:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH / DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> (which you use to tell the dynamic
linker at runtime where to find dynamically linked files) because I can&rsquo;t
remember the last time I ran into an <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> issue and couldn&rsquo;t
find an example.</li>
<li><code>pkg-config</code>, which I think is important but I don&rsquo;t understand yet</li>
</ul>

### [Standards for ANSI escape codes](https://jvns.ca/blog/2025/03/07/escape-code-standards/)

**来源**: Julia Evans

**摘要**: <p>Hello! Today I want to talk about ANSI escape codes.</p>
<p>For a long time I was vaguely aware of ANSI escape codes (&ldquo;that&rsquo;s how you make
text red in the terminal and stuff&rdquo;) but I had no real understanding of where they were
supposed to be defined or whether or not there were standards for them. I just
had a kind of vague &ldquo;there be dragons&rdquo; feeling around them. While learning
about the terminal this year, I&rsquo;ve learned that:</p>
<ol>
<li>ANSI escape codes are responsible for a lot of usability improvements
in the terminal (did you know there&rsquo;s a way to copy to your system clipboard
when SSHed into a remote machine?? It&rsquo;s an escape code called <a href="https://jvns.ca/til/vim-osc52/">OSC 52</a>!)</li>
<li>They aren&rsquo;t completely standardized, and because of that they don&rsquo;t always
work reliably. And because they&rsquo;re also invisible, it&rsquo;s extremely
frustrating to troubleshoot escape code issues.</li>
</ol>
<p>So I wanted to put together a list for myself of some standards that exist
around escape codes, because I want to know if they <em>have</em> to feel unreliable
and frustrating, or if there&rsquo;s a future where we could all rely on them with
more confidence.</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="what-s-an-escape-code">what&rsquo;s an escape code?</h3>
<p>Have you ever pressed the left arrow key in your terminal and seen <code>^[[D</code>?
That&rsquo;s an escape code! It&rsquo;s called an &ldquo;escape code&rdquo; because the first character
is the &ldquo;escape&rdquo; character, which is usually written as <code>ESC</code>, <code>\x1b</code>, <code>\E</code>,
<code>\033</code>, or <code>^[</code>.</p>
<p>Escape codes are how your terminal emulator communicates various kinds of
information (colours, mouse movement, etc) with programs running in the
terminal. There are two kind of escape codes:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>input codes</strong> which your terminal emulator sends for keypresses or mouse
movements that don&rsquo;t fit into Unicode. For example &ldquo;left arrow key&rdquo; is
<code>ESC[D</code>, &ldquo;Ctrl+left arrow&rdquo; might be <code>ESC[1;5D</code>, and clicking the mouse might
be something like <code>ESC[M :3</code>.</li>
<li><strong>output codes</strong> which programs can print out to colour text, move the
cursor around, clear the screen, hide the cursor, copy text to the
clipboard, enable mouse reporting, set the window title, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s talk about standards!</p>
<h3 id="ecma-48">ECMA-48</h3>
<p>The first standard I found relating to escape codes was
<a href="https://ecma-international.org/wp-content/uploads/ECMA-48_5th_edition_june_1991.pdf">ECMA-48</a>,
which was originally published in 1976.</p>
<p>ECMA-48 does two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Define some general <em>formats</em> for escape codes (like &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; codes, which are
<code>ESC[</code> + something and &ldquo;OSC&rdquo; codes, which are <code>ESC]</code> + something)</li>
<li>Define some specific escape codes, like how &ldquo;move the cursor to the left&rdquo; is
<code>ESC[D</code>, or &ldquo;turn text red&rdquo; is  <code>ESC[31m</code>. In the spec, the &ldquo;cursor left&rdquo;
one is called <code>CURSOR LEFT</code> and the one for changing colours is called
<code>SELECT GRAPHIC RENDITION</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The formats are extensible, so there&rsquo;s room for others to define more escape
codes in the future. Lots of escape codes that are popular today aren&rsquo;t defined
in ECMA-48: for example it&rsquo;s pretty common for terminal applications (like vim,
htop, or tmux) to support using the mouse, but ECMA-48 doesn&rsquo;t define escape
codes for the mouse.</p>
<h3 id="xterm-control-sequences">xterm control sequences</h3>
<p>There are a bunch of escape codes that aren&rsquo;t defined in ECMA-48, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>enabling mouse reporting (where did you click in your terminal?)</li>
<li>bracketed paste (did you paste that text or type it in?)</li>
<li>OSC 52 (which terminal applications can use to copy text to your system clipboard)</li>
</ul>
<p>I believe (correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong!) that these and some others came from
xterm, are documented in <a href="https://invisible-island.net/xterm/ctlseqs/ctlseqs.html">XTerm Control Sequences</a>, and have
been widely implemented by other terminal emulators.</p>
<p>This list of &ldquo;what xterm supports&rdquo; is not a standard exactly, but xterm is
extremely influential and so it seems like an important document.</p>
<h3 id="terminfo">terminfo</h3>
<p>In the 80s (and to some extent today, but my understanding is that it was MUCH
more dramatic in the 80s) there was a huge amount of variation in what escape
codes terminals actually supported.</p>
<p>To deal with this, there&rsquo;s a database of escape codes for various terminals
called &ldquo;terminfo&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It looks like the standard for terminfo is called <a href="https://publications.opengroup.org/c243-1">X/Open Curses</a>, though you need to create
an account to view that standard for some reason. It defines the database format as well
as a C library interface (&ldquo;curses&rdquo;) for accessing the database.</p>
<p>For example you can run this bash snippet to see every possible escape code for
&ldquo;clear screen&rdquo; for all of the different terminals your system knows about:</p>
<pre><code>for term in $(toe -a | awk '{print $1}')
do
  echo $term
  infocmp -1 -T &quot;$term&quot; 2&gt;/dev/null | grep 'clear=' | sed 's/clear=//g;s/,//g'
done
</code></pre>
<p>On my system (and probably every system I&rsquo;ve ever used?), the terminfo database is managed by ncurses.</p>
<h3 id="should-programs-use-terminfo">should programs use terminfo?</h3>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s interesting that there are two main approaches that applications
take to handling ANSI escape codes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use the terminfo database to figure out which escape codes to use, depending
on what&rsquo;s in the <code>TERM</code> environment variable. Fish does this, for example.</li>
<li>Identify a &ldquo;single common set&rdquo; of escape codes which works in &ldquo;enough&rdquo;
terminal emulators and just hardcode those.</li>
</ol>
<p>Some examples of programs/libraries that take approach #2 (&ldquo;don&rsquo;t use terminfo&rdquo;) include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/commit/c12699d2e9c2806d6ed184032078d0b84a3370bb">kakoune</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit/blob/165258d2f3ae594b50f16c7b50ffb06627476269/src/prompt_toolkit/input/ansi_escape_sequences.py#L5-L8">python-prompt-toolkit</a></li>

<li><a href="https://github.com/chalk/chalk">chalk</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I got curious about why folks might be moving away from terminfo and I found
this very interesting and extremely detailed
<a href="https://twoot.site/@bean/113056942625234032">rant about terminfo from one of the fish maintainers</a>, which argues that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[the terminfo authors] have done a lot of work that, at the time, was
extremely important and helpful. My point is that it no longer is.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to do it justice so I&rsquo;m not going to summarize it, I think it&rsquo;s
worth reading.</p>
<h3 id="is-there-a-single-common-set-of-escape-codes">is there a &ldquo;single common set&rdquo; of escape codes?</h3>
<p>I was just talking about the idea that you can use a &ldquo;common set&rdquo; of escape
codes that will work for most people. But what is that set? Is there any agreement?</p>
<p>I really do not know the answer to this at all, but from doing some reading it
seems like it&rsquo;s some combination of:</p>
<ul>
<li>The codes that the VT100 supported (though some aren&rsquo;t relevant on modern terminals)</li>
<li>what&rsquo;s in ECMA-48 (which I think also has some things that are no longer relevant)</li>
<li>What xterm supports (though I&rsquo;d guess that not everything in there is actually widely supported enough)</li>
</ul>
<p>and maybe ultimately &ldquo;identify the terminal emulators you think your users are
going to use most frequently and test in those&rdquo;, the same way web developers do
when deciding which CSS features are okay to use</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there are any resources like <a href="https://caniuse.com/">Can I use&hellip;?</a> or
<a href="https://web-platform-dx.github.io/web-features/">Baseline</a> for the terminal
though. (in theory terminfo is supposed to be the &ldquo;caniuse&rdquo; for the terminal
but it seems like it often takes 10+ years to add new terminal features when
people invent them which makes it very limited)</p>
<h3 id="some-reasons-to-use-terminfo">some reasons to use terminfo</h3>
<p>I also asked on Mastodon why people found terminfo valuable in 2025 and got a
few reasons that made sense to me:</p>
<ul>
<li>some people expect to be able to use the <code>TERM</code> environment variable to
control how programs behave (for example with <code>TERM=dumb</code>), and there&rsquo;s
no standard for how that should work in a post-terminfo world</li>
<li>even though there&rsquo;s <em>less</em> variation between terminal emulators than
there was in the 80s, there&rsquo;s far from zero variation: there are graphical
terminals, the Linux framebuffer console, the situation you&rsquo;re in when
connecting to a server via its serial console, Emacs shell mode, and probably
more that I&rsquo;m missing</li>
<li>there is no one standard for what the &ldquo;single common set&rdquo; of escape codes
is, and sometimes programs use escape codes which aren&rsquo;t actually widely
supported enough</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="terminfo-user-agent-detection">terminfo &amp; user agent detection</h3>
<p>The way that ncurses uses the <code>TERM</code> environment variable to decide which
escape codes to use reminds me of how webservers used to sometimes use the
browser user agent to decide which version of a website to serve.</p>
<p>It also seems like it&rsquo;s had some of the same results &ndash; the way iTerm2 reports
itself as being &ldquo;xterm-256color&rdquo; feels similar to how Safari&rsquo;s user agent is
&ldquo;Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 14_7_4) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML,
like Gecko) Version/18.3 Safari/605.1.15&rdquo;. In both cases the terminal emulator
/ browser ends up changing its user agent to get around user agent detection
that isn&rsquo;t working well.</p>
<p>On the web we ended up deciding that user agent detection was not a good
practice and to instead focus on standardization so we can serve the same
HTML/CSS to all browsers. I don&rsquo;t know if the same approach is the future in
the terminal though &ndash; I think the terminal landscape today is much more
fragmented than the web ever was as well as being much less well funded.</p>
<h3 id="some-more-documents-standards">some more documents/standards</h3>
<p>A few more documents and standards related to escape codes, in no particular order:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man4/console_codes.4.html">Linux console_codes man page</a> documents
escape codes that Linux supports</li>
<li>how the <a href="https://vt100.net/docs/vt100-ug/chapter3.html">VT 100</a> handles escape codes &amp; control sequences</li>
<li>the <a href="https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/keyboard-protocol/">kitty keyboard protocol</a></li>
<li><a href="https://gist.github.com/egmontkob/eb114294efbcd5adb1944c9f3cb5feda">OSC 8</a> for links in the terminal (and notes on <a href="https://github.com/Alhadis/OSC8-Adoption?tab=readme-ov-file">adoption</a>)</li>
<li>A <a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux/blob/882fb4d295deb3e4b803eb444915763305114e4f/tools/ansicode.txt">summary of ANSI standards from tmux</a></li>
<li>this <a href="https://iterm2.com/feature-reporting/">terminal features reporting specification from iTerm</a></li>
<li>sixel graphics</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-i-think-this-is-interesting">why I think this is interesting</h3>
<p>I sometimes see people saying that the unix terminal is &ldquo;outdated&rdquo;, and since I
love the terminal so much I&rsquo;m always curious about what incremental changes
might make it feel less &ldquo;outdated&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Maybe if we had a clearer standards landscape (like we do on the web!) it would
be easier for terminal emulator developers to build new features and for
authors of terminal applications to more confidently adopt those features so
that we can all benefit from them and have a richer experience in the terminal.</p>
<p>Obviously standardizing ANSI escape codes is not easy (ECMA-48 was first
published almost 50 years ago and we&rsquo;re still not there!). I don&rsquo;t even know
what all of the challenges are. But the situation with HTML/CSS/JS used to be
extremely bad too and now it&rsquo;s MUCH better, so maybe there&rsquo;s hope.</p>

### [How to add a directory to your PATH](https://jvns.ca/blog/2025/02/13/how-to-add-a-directory-to-your-path/)

**来源**: Julia Evans

**摘要**: <p>I was talking to a friend about how to add a directory to your PATH today. It&rsquo;s
something that feels &ldquo;obvious&rdquo; to me since I&rsquo;ve been using the terminal for a
long time, but when I searched for instructions for how to do it, I actually
couldn&rsquo;t find something that explained all of the steps &ndash; a lot of them just
said &ldquo;add this to <code>~/.bashrc</code>&rdquo;, but what if you&rsquo;re not using bash? What if your
bash config is actually in a different file? And how are you supposed to figure
out which directory to add anyway?</p>
<p>So I wanted to try to write down some more complete directions and mention some

</ul>
<h3 id="step-1-what-shell-are-you-using">step 1: what shell are you using?</h3>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not sure what shell you&rsquo;re using, here&rsquo;s a way to find out. Run this:</p>
<pre><code>ps -p $$ -o pid,comm=
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>if you&rsquo;re using <strong>bash</strong>, it&rsquo;ll print out <code>97295 bash</code></li>
<li>if you&rsquo;re using <strong>zsh</strong>, it&rsquo;ll print out <code>97295 zsh</code></li>
<li>if you&rsquo;re using <strong>fish</strong>, it&rsquo;ll print out an error like &ldquo;In fish, please use
$fish_pid&rdquo; (<code>$$</code> isn&rsquo;t valid syntax in fish, but in any case the error
message tells you that you&rsquo;re using fish, which you probably already knew)</li>
</ul>
<p>Also bash is the default on Linux and zsh is the default on Mac OS (as of
2024). I&rsquo;ll only cover bash, zsh, and fish in these directions.</p>
<h3 id="step-2-find-your-shell-s-config-file">step 2: find your shell&rsquo;s config file</h3>
<ul>
<li>in zsh, it&rsquo;s probably <code>~/.zshrc</code></li>
<li>in bash, it might be <code>~/.bashrc</code>, but it&rsquo;s complicated, see the note in the next section</li>
<li>in fish, it&rsquo;s probably <code>~/.config/fish/config.fish</code> (you can run <code>echo $__fish_config_dir</code> if you want to be 100% sure)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="a-note-on-bash-s-config-file">a note on bash&rsquo;s config file</h3>
<p>Bash has three possible config files: <code>~/.bashrc</code>, <code>~/.bash_profile</code>, and <code>~/.profile</code>.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not sure which one your system is set up to use, I&rsquo;d recommend
testing this way:</p>
<ol>
<li>add <code>echo hi there</code> to your <code>~/.bashrc</code></li>
<li>Restart your terminal</li>
<li>If you see &ldquo;hi there&rdquo;, that means <code>~/.bashrc</code> is being used! Hooray!</li>
<li>Otherwise remove it and try the same thing with <code>~/.bash_profile</code></li>
<li>You can also try <code>~/.profile</code> if the first two options don&rsquo;t work.</li>
</ol>
<p>(there are a lot of <a href="https://blog.flowblok.id.au/2013-02/shell-startup-scripts.html">elaborate flow charts</a> out there that explain how bash
decides which config file to use but IMO it&rsquo;s not worth it to internalize them
and just testing is the fastest way to be sure)</p>
<h3 id="step-3-figure-out-which-directory-to-add">step 3: figure out which directory to add</h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say that you&rsquo;re trying to install and run a program called <code>http-server</code>
and it doesn&rsquo;t work, like this:</p>
<pre><code>$ npm install -g http-server
$ http-server
bash: http-server: command not found
</code></pre>
<p>How do you find what directory <code>http-server</code> is in? Honestly in general this is
not that easy &ndash; often the answer is something like &ldquo;it depends on how npm is
configured&rdquo;. A few ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Often when setting up a new installer (like <code>cargo</code>, <code>npm</code>, <code>homebrew</code>, etc),
when you first set it up it&rsquo;ll print out some directions about how to update
your PATH. So if you&rsquo;re paying attention you can get the directions then.</li>
<li>Sometimes installers will automatically update your shell&rsquo;s config file
to update your <code>PATH</code> for you</li>
<li>Sometimes just Googling &ldquo;where does npm install things?&rdquo; will turn up the
answer</li>
<li>Some tools have a subcommand that tells you where they&rsquo;re configured to
install things, like:
<ul>
<li>Node/npm: <code>npm config get prefix</code> (then append <code>/bin/</code>)</li>
<li>Go: <code>go env GOPATH</code> (then append <code>/bin/</code>)</li>
<li>asdf: <code>asdf info | grep ASDF_DIR</code> (then append <code>/bin/</code> and <code>/shims/</code>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-3-1-double-check-it-s-the-right-directory">step 3.1: double check it&rsquo;s the right directory</h3>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve found a directory you think might be the right one, make sure it&rsquo;s
actually correct! For example, I found out that on my machine, <code>http-server</code> is
in <code>~/.npm-global/bin</code>. I can make sure that it&rsquo;s the right directory by trying to
run the program <code>http-server</code> in that directory like this:</p>
<pre><code>$ ~/.npm-global/bin/http-server
Starting up http-server, serving ./public
</code></pre>
<p>It worked! Now that you know what directory you need to add to your <code>PATH</code>,
let&rsquo;s move to the next step!</p>
<h3 id="step-4-edit-your-shell-config">step 4: edit your shell config</h3>
<p>Now we have the 2 critical pieces of information we need:</p>
<ol>
<li>Which directory you&rsquo;re trying to add to your PATH (like  <code>~/.npm-global/bin/</code>)</li>
<li>Where your shell&rsquo;s config is (like <code>~/.bashrc</code>, <code>~/.zshrc</code>, or <code>~/.config/fish/config.fish</code>)</li>
</ol>
<p>Now what you need to add depends on your shell:</p>
<p><strong>bash instructions:</strong></p>
<p>Open your shell&rsquo;s config file, and add a line like this:</p>
<pre><code>export PATH=$PATH:~/.npm-global/bin/
</code></pre>
<p>(obviously replace <code>~/.npm-global/bin</code> with the actual directory you&rsquo;re trying to add)</p>
<p><strong>zsh instructions:</strong></p>
<p>You can do the same thing as in bash, but zsh also has some slightly fancier
syntax you can use if you prefer:</p>
<pre><code>path=(
  $path
  ~/.npm-global/bin
)
</code></pre>
<p><strong>fish instructions:</strong></p>
<p>In fish, the syntax is different:</p>
<pre><code>set PATH $PATH ~/.npm-global/bin
</code></pre>
<p>(in fish you can also use <code>fish_add_path</code>, some notes on that <a href="https://jvns.ca/atom.xml#a-note-on-fish-add-path">further down</a>)</p>
<h3 id="step-5-restart-your-shell">step 5: restart your shell</h3>
<p>Now, an extremely important step: updating your shell&rsquo;s config won&rsquo;t take
effect if you don&rsquo;t restart it!</p>
<p>Two ways to do this:</p>
<ol>
<li>open a new terminal (or terminal tab), and maybe close the old one so you don&rsquo;t get confused</li>
<li>Run <code>bash</code> to start a new shell (or <code>zsh</code> if you&rsquo;re using zsh, or <code>fish</code> if you&rsquo;re using fish)</li>
</ol>
<p>I&rsquo;ve found that both of these usually work fine.</p>
<p>And you should be done! Try running the program you were trying to run and
hopefully it works now.</p>
<p>If not, here are a couple of problems that you might run into:</p>
<h3 id="problem-1-it-ran-the-wrong-program">problem 1: it ran the wrong program</h3>
<p>If the wrong <strong>version</strong> of a program is running, you might need to add the
directory to the <em>beginning</em> of your PATH instead of the end.</p>
<p>For example, on my system I have two versions of <code>python3</code> installed, which I
can see by running <code>which -a</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ which -a python3
/usr/bin/python3
/opt/homebrew/bin/python3
</code></pre>
<p>The one your shell will use is the <strong>first one listed</strong>.</p>
<p>If you want to use the Homebrew version, you need to add that directory
(<code>/opt/homebrew/bin</code>) to the <strong>beginning</strong> of your PATH instead, by putting this in
your shell&rsquo;s config file (it&rsquo;s <code>/opt/homebrew/bin/:$PATH</code> instead of the usual <code>$PATH:/opt/homebrew/bin/</code>)</p>
<pre><code>export PATH=/opt/homebrew/bin/:$PATH
</code></pre>
<p>or in fish:</p>
<pre><code>set PATH ~/.cargo/bin $PATH
</code></pre>
<h3 id="problem-2-the-program-isn-t-being-run-from-your-shell">problem 2: the program isn&rsquo;t being run from your shell</h3>
<p>All of these directions only work if you&rsquo;re running the program <strong>from your
shell</strong>. If you&rsquo;re running the program from an IDE, from a GUI, in a cron job,
or some other way, you&rsquo;ll need to add the directory to your PATH in a different
way, and the exact details might depend on the situation.</p>
<p><strong>in a cron job</strong></p>
<p>Some options:</p>
<ul>
<li>use the full path to the program you&rsquo;re running, like <code>/home/bork/bin/my-program</code></li>
<li>put the full PATH you want as the first line of your crontab (something like
PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:&hellip;.). You can get the full PATH you&rsquo;re
using in your shell by running <code>echo &quot;PATH=$PATH&quot;</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m honestly not sure how to handle it in an IDE/GUI because I haven&rsquo;t run into
that in a long time, will add directions here if someone points me in the right
direction.</p>
<h3 id="problem-3-duplicate-path-entries-making-it-harder-to-debug">problem 3: duplicate <code>PATH</code> entries making it harder to debug</h3>
<p>If you edit your path and start a new shell by running <code>bash</code> (or <code>zsh</code>, or
<code>fish</code>), you&rsquo;ll often end up with duplicate <code>PATH</code> entries, because the shell
keeps adding new things to your <code>PATH</code> every time you start your shell.</p>
<p>Personally I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve run into a situation where this kind of
duplication breaks anything, but the duplicates can make it harder to debug
what&rsquo;s going on with your <code>PATH</code> if you&rsquo;re trying to understand its contents.</p>
<p>Some ways you could deal with this:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you&rsquo;re debugging your <code>PATH</code>, open a new terminal to do it in so you get
a &ldquo;fresh&rdquo; state. This should avoid the duplication.</li>
<li>Deduplicate your <code>PATH</code> at the end of your shell&rsquo;s config  (for example in
zsh apparently you can do this with <code>typeset -U path</code>)</li>
<li>Check that the directory isn&rsquo;t already in your <code>PATH</code> when adding it (for
example in fish I believe you can do this with <code>fish_add_path --path /some/directory</code>)</li>
</ol>
<p>How to deduplicate your <code>PATH</code> is shell-specific and there isn&rsquo;t always a
built in way to do it so you&rsquo;ll need to look up how to accomplish it in your
shell.</p>
<h3 id="problem-4-losing-your-history-after-updating-your-path">problem 4: losing your history after updating your <code>PATH</code></h3>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a situation that&rsquo;s easy to get into in bash or zsh:</p>
<ol>
<li>Run a command (it fails)</li>
<li>Update your <code>PATH</code></li>
<li>Run <code>bash</code> to reload your config</li>
<li>Press the up arrow a couple of times to rerun the failed command (or open a new terminal)</li>
<li>The failed command isn&rsquo;t in your history! Why not?</li>
</ol>
<p>This happens because in bash, by default, history is not saved until you exit
the shell.</p>
<p>Some options for fixing this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of running <code>bash</code> to reload your config, run <code>source ~/.bashrc</code> (or
<code>source ~/.zshrc</code> in zsh). This will reload the config inside your current
session.</li>
<li>Configure your shell to continuously save your history instead of only saving
the history when the shell exits. (How to do this depends on whether you&rsquo;re
using bash or zsh, the history options in zsh are a bit complicated and I&rsquo;m
not exactly sure what the best way is)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="a-note-on-source">a note on <code>source</code></h3>
<p>When you install <code>cargo</code> (Rust&rsquo;s installer) for the first time, it gives you
these instructions for how to set up your PATH, which don&rsquo;t mention a specific
directory at all.</p>
<pre><code>This is usually done by running one of the following (note the leading DOT):

. &quot;$HOME/.cargo/env&quot;        	# For sh/bash/zsh/ash/dash/pdksh
source &quot;$HOME/.cargo/env.fish&quot;  # For fish
</code></pre>
<p>The idea is that you add that line to your shell&rsquo;s config, and their script
automatically sets up your <code>PATH</code> (and potentially other things) for you.</p>
<p>This is pretty common (for example <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/install/blob/deacfa6a6e62e5f4002baf9e1fac7a96e9aa5d41/install.sh#L1072-L1087">Homebrew</a> suggests you eval <code>brew shellenv</code>), and there are
two ways to approach this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Just do what the tool suggests (like adding <code>. &quot;$HOME/.cargo/env&quot;</code> to your shell&rsquo;s config)</li>
<li>Figure out which directories the script they&rsquo;re telling you to run would add
to your PATH, and then add those manually. Here&rsquo;s how I&rsquo;d do that:
<ul>
<li>Run <code>. &quot;$HOME/.cargo/env&quot;</code> in my shell (or the fish version if using fish)</li>
<li>Run <code>echo &quot;$PATH&quot; | tr ':' '\n' | grep cargo</code> to figure out which directories it added</li>
<li>See that it says <code>/Users/bork/.cargo/bin</code> and shorten that to <code>~/.cargo/bin</code></li>
<li>Add the directory <code>~/.cargo/bin</code> to PATH (with the directions in this post)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s anything wrong with doing what the tool suggests (it
might be the &ldquo;best way&rdquo;!), but personally I usually use the second approach
because I prefer knowing exactly what configuration I&rsquo;m changing.</p>
<h3 id="a-note-on-fish-add-path">a note on <code>fish_add_path</code></h3>
<p>fish has a handy function called <code>fish_add_path</code> that you can run to add a directory to your <code>PATH</code> like this:</p>
<pre><code>fish_add_path /some/directory
</code></pre>
<p>This is cool (it&rsquo;s such a simple command!) but I&rsquo;ve stopped using it for a couple of reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sometimes <code>fish_add_path</code> will update the <code>PATH</code> for every session in the
future (with a &ldquo;universal variable&rdquo;) and sometimes it will update the <code>PATH</code>
just for the current session and it&rsquo;s hard for me to tell which one it will
do. In theory the docs explain this but I could not understand them.</li>
<li>If you ever need to <em>remove</em> the directory from your <code>PATH</code> a few weeks or
months later because maybe you made a mistake, it&rsquo;s kind of hard to do
(there are <a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8604">instructions in this comments of this github issue though</a>).</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="that-s-all">that&rsquo;s all</h3>
<p>Hopefully this will help some people. Let me know (on Mastodon or Bluesky) if
you there are other major gotchas that have tripped you up when adding a
directory to your PATH, or if you have questions about this post!</p>

### [Some terminal frustrations](https://jvns.ca/blog/2025/02/05/some-terminal-frustrations/)

**来源**: Julia Evans

**摘要**: <p>A few weeks ago I ran a terminal survey (you can <a href="https://jvns.ca/terminal-survey/results-bsky.html">read the results here</a>) and at the end I asked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What’s the most frustrating thing about using the terminal for you?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>1600 people answered, and I decided to spend a few days categorizing all the
responses. Along the way I learned that classifying qualitative data is not
easy but I gave it my best shot. I ended up building a custom
<a href="https://github.com/jvns/classificator">tool</a> to make it faster to categorize
everything.</p>
<p>As with all of my surveys the methodology isn&rsquo;t particularly scientific. I just
posted the survey to Mastodon and Twitter, ran it for a couple of days, and got
answers from whoever happened to see it and felt like responding.</p>
<p>Here are the top categories of frustrations!</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s worth keeping in mind while reading these comments that</p>
<ul>
<li>40% of people answering this survey have been using the terminal for <strong>21+ years</strong></li>
<li>95% of people answering the survey have been using the terminal for at least 4 years</li>
</ul>
<p>These comments aren&rsquo;t coming from total beginners.</p>
<p>Here are the categories of frustrations! The number in brackets is the number
of people with that frustration. I&rsquo;m mostly writing this up for myself because
I&rsquo;m trying to write a zine about the terminal and I wanted to get a sense for
what people are having trouble with.</p>
<h3 id="remembering-syntax-115">remembering syntax (115)</h3>
<p>People talked about struggles remembering:</p>
<ul>
<li>the syntax for CLI tools like awk, jq, sed, etc</li>
<li>the syntax for redirects</li>
<li>keyboard shortcuts for tmux, text editing, etc</li>
</ul>
<p>One example comment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are just so many little &ldquo;trivia&rdquo; details to remember for full
functionality. Even after all these years I&rsquo;ll sometimes forget where it&rsquo;s 2
or 1 for stderr, or forget which is which for <code>&gt;</code> and <code>&gt;&gt;</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="switching-terminals-is-hard-91">switching terminals is hard (91)</h3>
<p>People talked about struggling with switching systems (for example home/work
computer or when SSHing) and running into:</p>
<ul>
<li>OS differences in keyboard shortcuts (like Linux vs Mac)</li>
<li>systems which don&rsquo;t have their preferred text editor (&ldquo;no vim&rdquo; or &ldquo;only vim&rdquo;)</li>
<li>different versions of the same command (like Mac OS grep vs GNU grep)</li>
<li>no tab completion</li>
<li>a shell they aren&rsquo;t used to (&ldquo;the subtle differences between zsh and bash&rdquo;)</li>
</ul>
<p>as well as differences inside the same system like pagers being not consistent
with each other (git diff pagers, other pagers).</p>
<p>One example comment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I got used to fish and vi mode which are not available when I ssh into
servers, containers.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="color-85">color (85)</h3>
<p>Lots of problems with color, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>programs setting colors that are unreadable with a light background color</li>
<li>finding a colorscheme they like (and getting it to work consistently across different apps)</li>
<li>color not working inside several layers of SSH/tmux/etc</li>
<li>not liking the defaults</li>
<li>not wanting color at all and struggling to turn it off</li>
</ul>
<p>This comment felt relatable to me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Getting my terminal theme configured in a reasonable way between the terminal
emulator and fish (I did this years ago and remember it being tedious and
fiddly and now feel like I&rsquo;m locked into my current theme because it works
and I dread touching any of that configuration ever again).</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="keyboard-shortcuts-84">keyboard shortcuts (84)</h3>
<p>Half of the comments on keyboard shortcuts were about how on Linux/Windows, the
keyboard shortcut to copy/paste in the terminal is different from in the rest
of the OS.</p>
<p>Some other issues with keyboard shortcuts other than copy/paste:</p>
<ul>
<li>using <code>Ctrl-W</code> in a browser-based terminal and closing the window</li>
<li>the terminal only supports a limited set of keyboard shortcuts (no
<code>Ctrl-Shift-</code>, no <code>Super</code>, no <code>Hyper</code>, lots of <code>ctrl-</code> shortcuts aren&rsquo;t
possible like <code>Ctrl-,</code>)</li>
<li>the OS stopping you from using a terminal keyboard shortcut (like by default
Mac OS uses <code>Ctrl+left arrow</code> for something else)</li>
<li>issues using emacs in the terminal</li>
<li>backspace not working (2)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="other-copy-and-paste-issues-75">other copy and paste issues (75)</h3>
<p>Aside from &ldquo;the keyboard shortcut for copy and paste is different&rdquo;, there were
a lot of OTHER issues with copy and paste, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>copying over SSH</li>
<li>how tmux and the terminal emulator both do copy/paste in different ways</li>
<li>dealing with many different clipboards (system clipboard, vim clipboard, the
&ldquo;middle click&rdquo; clipboard on Linux, tmux&rsquo;s clipboard, etc) and potentially
synchronizing them</li>
<li>random spaces added when copying from the terminal</li>
<li>pasting multiline commands which automatically get run in a terrifying way</li>
<li>wanting a way to copy text without using the mouse</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="discoverability-55">discoverability (55)</h3>
<p>There were lots of comments about this, which all came down to the same basic
complaint &ndash; it&rsquo;s hard to discover useful tools or features! This comment kind of
summed it all up:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How difficult it is to learn independently. Most of what I know is an
assorted collection of stuff I&rsquo;ve been told by random people over the years.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="steep-learning-curve-44">steep learning curve (44)</h3>
<p>A lot of comments about it generally having a steep learning curve. A couple of
example comments:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After 15 years of using it, I’m not much faster than using it than I was 5 or
maybe even 10 years ago.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That I know I could make my life easier by learning more about the shortcuts
and commands and configuring the terminal but I don&rsquo;t spend the time because it
feels overwhelming.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="history-42">history  (42)</h3>
<p>Some issues with shell history:</p>
<ul>
<li>history not being shared between terminal tabs (16)</li>
<li>limits that are too short (4)</li>
<li>history not being restored when terminal tabs are restored</li>
<li>losing history because the terminal crashed</li>
<li>not knowing how to search history</li>
</ul>
<p>One example comment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It wasted a lot of time until I figured it out and still annoys me that
&ldquo;history&rdquo; on zsh has such a small buffer;  I have to type &ldquo;history 0&rdquo; to get
any useful length of history.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="bad-documentation-37">bad documentation (37)</h3>
<p>People talked about:</p>
<ul>
<li>documentation being generally opaque</li>
<li>lack of examples in man pages</li>
<li>programs which don&rsquo;t have man pages</li>
</ul>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a representative comment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Finding good examples and docs. Man pages often not enough, have to wade
through stack overflow</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="scrollback-36">scrollback (36)</h3>
<p>A few issues with scrollback:</p>
<ul>
<li>programs printing out too much data making you lose scrollback history</li>
<li>resizing the terminal messes up the scrollback</li>
<li>lack of timestamps</li>
<li>GUI programs that you start in the background printing stuff out that gets in
the way of other programs&rsquo; outputs</li>
</ul>
<p>One example comment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When resizing the terminal (in particular: making it narrower) leads to
broken rewrapping of the scrollback content because the commands formatted
their output based on the terminal window width.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="it-feels-outdated-33">&ldquo;it feels outdated&rdquo; (33)</h3>
<p>Lots of comments about how the terminal feels hampered by legacy decisions and
how users often end up needing to learn implementation details that feel very
esoteric. One example comment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most of the legacy cruft, it would be great to have a green field
implementation of the CLI interface.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="shell-scripting-32">shell scripting (32)</h3>
<p>Lots of complaints about POSIX shell scripting. There&rsquo;s a general feeling that
shell scripting is difficult but also that switching to a different less
standard scripting language (fish, nushell, etc) brings its own problems.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shell scripting. My tolerance to ditch a shell script and go to a scripting
language is pretty low. It’s just too messy and powerful. Screwing up can be
costly so I don’t even bother.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="more-issues">more issues</h3>
<p>Some more issues that were mentioned at least 10 times:</p>
<ul>
<li>(31) inconsistent command line arguments: is it -h or help or &ndash;help?</li>
<li>(24) keeping dotfiles in sync across different systems</li>
<li>(23) performance (e.g. &ldquo;my shell takes too long to start&rdquo;)</li>
<li>(20) window management (potentially with some combination of tmux tabs, terminal tabs, and multiple terminal windows. Where did that shell session go?)</li>
<li>(17) generally feeling scared/uneasy (&ldquo;The debilitating fear that I’m going
to do some mysterious Bad Thing with a command and I will have absolutely no
idea how to fix or undo it or even really figure out what happened&rdquo;)</li>
<li>(16) terminfo issues (&ldquo;Having to learn about terminfo if/when I try a new terminal emulator and ssh elsewhere.&rdquo;)</li>
<li>(16) lack of image support (sixel etc)</li>
<li>(15) SSH issues (like having to start over when you lose the SSH connection)</li>
<li>(15) various tmux/screen issues (for example lack of integration between tmux and the terminal emulator)</li>
<li>(15) typos &amp; slow typing</li>
<li>(13) the terminal getting messed up for various reasons (pressing <code>Ctrl-S</code>, <code>cat</code>ing a binary, etc)</li>
<li>(12) quoting/escaping in the shell</li>
<li>(11) various Windows/PowerShell issues</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="n-a-122">n/a (122)</h3>
<p>There were also 122 answers to the effect of &ldquo;nothing really&rdquo; or &ldquo;only that I
can&rsquo;t do EVERYTHING in the terminal&rdquo;</p>
<p>One example comment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Think I&rsquo;ve found work arounds for most/all frustrations</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="that-s-all">that&rsquo;s all!</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to make a lot of commentary on these results, but here are a
couple of categories that feel related to me:</p>
<ul>
<li>remembering syntax &amp; history (often the thing you need to remember is something you&rsquo;ve run before!)</li>
<li>discoverability &amp; the learning curve (the lack of discoverability is definitely a big part of what makes it hard to learn)</li>
<li>&ldquo;switching systems is hard&rdquo; &amp; &ldquo;it feels outdated&rdquo; (tools that haven&rsquo;t really
changed in 30 or 40 years have many problems but they do tend to be always
<em>there</em> no matter what system you&rsquo;re on, which is very useful and makes them
hard to stop using)</li>
</ul>
<p>Trying to categorize all these results in a reasonable way really gave me an
appreciation for social science researchers&rsquo; skills.</p>

### [What's involved in getting a "modern" terminal setup?](https://jvns.ca/blog/2025/01/11/getting-a-modern-terminal-setup/)

**来源**: Julia Evans

**摘要**: <p>Hello! Recently I ran a terminal survey and I asked people what frustrated
them. One person commented:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are so many pieces to having a modern terminal experience. I wish it
all came out of the box.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My immediate reaction was &ldquo;oh, getting a modern terminal experience isn&rsquo;t that
hard, you just need to&hellip;.&rdquo;, but the more I thought about it, the longer the
&ldquo;you just need to&hellip;&rdquo; list got, and I kept thinking about more and more
caveats.</p>
<p>So I thought I would write down some notes about what it means to me personally
to have a &ldquo;modern&rdquo; terminal experience and what I think can make it hard for
people to get there.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-a-modern-terminal-experience">what is a &ldquo;modern terminal experience&rdquo;?</h3>
<p>Here are a few things that are important to me, with which part of the system
is responsible for them:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>multiline support for copy and paste</strong>: if you paste 3 commands in your shell, it should not immediately run them all! That&rsquo;s scary! (<strong>shell</strong>, <strong>terminal emulator</strong>)</li>
<li><strong>infinite shell history</strong>: if I run a command in my shell, it should be saved forever, not deleted after 500 history entries or whatever. Also I want commands to be saved to the history immediately when I run them, not only when I exit the shell session (<strong>shell</strong>)</li>
<li><strong>a useful prompt</strong>: I can&rsquo;t live without having my <strong>current directory</strong> and <strong>current git branch</strong> in my prompt (<strong>shell</strong>)</li>
<li><strong>24-bit colour</strong>: this is important to me because I find it MUCH easier to theme neovim with 24-bit colour support than in a terminal with only 256 colours (<strong>terminal emulator</strong>)</li>
<li><strong>clipboard integration</strong> between vim and my operating system so that when I copy in Firefox, I can just press <code>p</code> in vim to paste (<strong>text editor</strong>, maybe the OS/terminal emulator too)</li>
<li><strong>good autocomplete</strong>: for example commands like git should have command-specific autocomplete (<strong>shell</strong>)</li>
<li><strong>having colours in <code>ls</code></strong> (<strong>shell config</strong>)</li>
<li><strong>a terminal theme I like</strong>: I spend a lot of time in my terminal, I want it to look nice and I want its theme to match my terminal editor&rsquo;s theme. (<strong>terminal emulator</strong>, <strong>text editor</strong>)</li>
<li><strong>automatic terminal fixing</strong>: If a programs prints out some weird escape
codes that mess up my terminal, I want that to automatically get reset so
that my terminal doesn&rsquo;t get messed up (<strong>shell</strong>)</li>
<li><strong>keybindings</strong>: I want <code>Ctrl+left arrow</code> to work (<strong>shell</strong> or <strong>application</strong>)</li>
<li><strong>being able to use the scroll wheel in programs like <code>less</code></strong>: (<strong>terminal emulator</strong> and <strong>applications</strong>)</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a million other terminal conveniences out there and different people
value different things, but those are the ones that I would be really unhappy
without.</p>
<h3 id="how-i-achieve-a-modern-experience">how I achieve a &ldquo;modern experience&rdquo;</h3>
<p>My basic approach is:</p>
<ol>
<li>use the <code>fish</code> shell. Mostly don&rsquo;t configure it, except to:
<ul>
<li>set the <code>EDITOR</code> environment variable to my favourite terminal editor</li>
<li>alias <code>ls</code> to <code>ls --color=auto</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>use any terminal emulator with 24-bit colour support. In the past I&rsquo;ve used
GNOME Terminal, Terminator, and iTerm, but I&rsquo;m not picky about this. I don&rsquo;t really
configure it other than to choose a font.</li>
<li>use <code>neovim</code>, with a configuration that I&rsquo;ve been very slowly building over the last 9 years or so (the last time I deleted my vim config and started from scratch was 9 years ago)</li>
<li>use the <a href="https://github.com/chriskempson/base16">base16 framework</a> to theme everything</li>
</ol>
<p>A few things that affect my approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>I don&rsquo;t spend a lot of time SSHed into other machines</li>
<li>I&rsquo;d rather use the mouse a little than come up with keyboard-based ways to do everything</li>
<li>I work on a lot of small projects, not one big project</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="some-out-of-the-box-options-for-a-modern-experience">some &ldquo;out of the box&rdquo; options for a &ldquo;modern&rdquo; experience</h3>
<p>What if you want a nice experience, but don&rsquo;t want to spend a lot of time on
configuration? Figuring out how to configure vim in a way that I was satisfied
with really did take me like ten years, which is a long time!</p>
<p>My best ideas for how to get a reasonable terminal experience with minimal
config are:</p>
<ul>
<li>shell: either <code>fish</code> or <code>zsh</code> with <a href="https://ohmyz.sh/">oh-my-zsh</a></li>
<li>terminal emulator: almost anything with 24-bit colour support, for example all of these are popular:
<ul>
<li>linux: GNOME Terminal, Konsole, Terminator, xfce4-terminal</li>
<li>mac: iTerm (Terminal.app doesn&rsquo;t have 256-colour support)</li>
<li>cross-platform: kitty, alacritty, wezterm, or ghostty</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>shell config:
<ul>
<li>set the <code>EDITOR</code> environment variable to your favourite terminal text
editor</li>
<li>maybe alias <code>ls</code> to <code>ls --color=auto</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>text editor: this is a tough one, maybe <a href="https://micro-editor.github.io/">micro</a> or <a href="https://helix-editor.com/">helix</a>? I haven&rsquo;t used
either of them seriously but they both seem like very cool projects and I
think it&rsquo;s amazing that you can just use all the usual GUI editor commands
(<code>Ctrl-C</code> to copy, <code>Ctrl-V</code> to paste, <code>Ctrl-A</code> to select all) in micro and
they do what you&rsquo;d expect. I would probably try switching to helix except
that retraining my vim muscle memory seems way too hard. Also helix doesn&rsquo;t
have a GUI or plugin system yet.</li>
</ul>
<p>Personally I <strong>wouldn&rsquo;t</strong> use xterm, rxvt, or Terminal.app as a terminal emulator,
because I&rsquo;ve found in the past that they&rsquo;re missing core features (like 24-bit
colour in Terminal.app&rsquo;s case) that make the terminal harder to use for me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to pretend that getting a &ldquo;modern&rdquo; terminal experience is easier
than it is though &ndash; I think there are two issues that make it hard. Let&rsquo;s talk
about them!</p>
<h3 id="issue-1-with-getting-to-a-modern-experience-the-shell">issue 1 with getting to a &ldquo;modern&rdquo; experience: the shell</h3>
<p>bash and zsh are by far the two most popular shells, and neither of them
provide a default experience that I would be happy using out of the box, for
example:</p>
<ul>
<li>you need to customize your prompt</li>
<li>they don&rsquo;t come with git completions by default, you have to set them up</li>
<li>by default, bash only stores 500 (!) lines of history and (at least on Mac OS)
zsh is only configured to store 2000 lines, which is still not a lot</li>
<li>I find bash&rsquo;s tab completion very frustrating, if there&rsquo;s more than
one match then you can&rsquo;t tab through them</li>
</ul>
<p>And even though <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2024/09/12/reasons-i--still--love-fish/">I love fish</a>, the fact
that it isn&rsquo;t POSIX does make it hard for a lot of folks to make the switch.</p>
<p>Of course it&rsquo;s totally possible to learn how to customize your prompt in bash
or whatever, and it doesn&rsquo;t even need to be that complicated (in bash I&rsquo;d
probably start with something like <code>export PS1='[\u@\h \W$(__git_ps1 &quot; (%s)&quot;)]\$ '</code>, or maybe use <a href="https://starship.rs/">starship</a>).
But each of these &ldquo;not complicated&rdquo; things really does add up and it&rsquo;s
especially tough if you need to keep your config in sync across several
systems.</p>
<p>An extremely popular solution to getting a &ldquo;modern&rdquo; shell experience is
<a href="https://ohmyz.sh/">oh-my-zsh</a>. It seems like a great project and I know a lot
of people use it very happily, but I&rsquo;ve struggled with configuration systems
like that in the past &ndash; it looks like right now the base oh-my-zsh adds about
3000 lines of config, and often I find that having an extra configuration
system makes it harder to debug what&rsquo;s happening when things go wrong. I
personally have a tendency to use the system to add a lot of extra plugins,
make my system slow, get frustrated that it&rsquo;s slow, and then delete it
completely and write a new config from scratch.</p>
<h3 id="issue-2-with-getting-to-a-modern-experience-the-text-editor">issue 2 with getting to a &ldquo;modern&rdquo; experience: the text editor</h3>
<p>In the terminal survey I ran recently, the most popular terminal text editors
by far were <code>vim</code>, <code>emacs</code>, and <code>nano</code>.</p>
<p>I think the main options for terminal text editors are:</p>
<ul>
<li>use vim or emacs and configure it to your liking, you can probably have any
feature you want if you put in the work</li>
<li>use nano and accept that you&rsquo;re going to have a pretty limited experience
(for example I don&rsquo;t think you can select text with the mouse and then &ldquo;cut&rdquo;
it in nano)</li>
<li>use <code>micro</code> or <code>helix</code> which seem to offer a pretty good out-of-the-box
experience, potentially occasionally run into issues with using a less
mainstream text editor</li>
<li>just avoid using a terminal text editor as much as possible, maybe use VSCode, use
VSCode&rsquo;s terminal for all your terminal needs, and mostly never edit files in
the terminal. Or I know a lot of people use <code>code</code> as their <code>EDITOR</code> in the terminal.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="issue-3-individual-applications">issue 3: individual applications</h3>
<p>The last issue is that sometimes individual programs that I use are kind of
annoying. For example on my Mac OS machine, <code>/usr/bin/sqlite3</code> doesn&rsquo;t support
the <code>Ctrl+Left Arrow</code> keyboard shortcut. Fixing this to get a reasonable
terminal experience in SQLite was a little complicated, I had to:</p>
<ul>
<li>realize why this is happening (Mac OS won&rsquo;t ship GNU tools, and &ldquo;Ctrl-Left arrow&rdquo; support comes from GNU readline)</li>
<li>find a workaround (install sqlite from homebrew, which does have readline support)</li>
<li>adjust my environment (put Homebrew&rsquo;s sqlite3 in my PATH)</li>
</ul>
<p>I find that debugging application-specific issues like this is really not easy
and often it doesn&rsquo;t feel &ldquo;worth it&rdquo; &ndash; often I&rsquo;ll end up just dealing with
various minor inconveniences because I don&rsquo;t want to spend hours investigating
them. The only reason I was even able to figure this one out at all is that
I&rsquo;ve been spending a huge amount of time thinking about the terminal recently.</p>
<p>A big part of having a &ldquo;modern&rdquo; experience using terminal programs is just
using newer terminal programs, for example I can&rsquo;t be bothered to learn a
keyboard shortcut to sort the columns in <code>top</code>, but in <code>htop</code>  I can just click
on a column heading with my mouse to sort it. So I use htop instead! But discovering new more &ldquo;modern&rdquo; command line tools isn&rsquo;t easy (though
I made <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2022/04/12/a-list-of-new-ish--command-line-tools/">a list here</a>),
finding ones that I actually like using in practice takes time, and if you&rsquo;re
SSHed into another machine, they won&rsquo;t always be there.</p>
<h3 id="everything-affects-everything-else">everything affects everything else</h3>
<p>Something I find tricky about configuring my terminal to make everything &ldquo;nice&rdquo;
is that changing one seemingly small thing about my workflow can really affect
everything else. For example right now I don&rsquo;t use tmux. But if I needed to use
tmux again (for example because I was doing a lot of work SSHed into another
machine), I&rsquo;d need to think about a few things, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>if I wanted tmux&rsquo;s copy to synchronize with my system clipboard over
SSH, I&rsquo;d need to make sure that my terminal emulator has <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/k1ydpn/a_guide_on_how_to_copy_text_from_anywhere/">OSC 52 support</a></li>
<li>if I wanted to use iTerm&rsquo;s tmux integration (which makes tmux tabs into iTerm
tabs), I&rsquo;d need to change how I configure colours &ndash; right now I set them
with a <a href="https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-shell/blob/588691ba71b47e75793ed9edfcfaa058326a6f41/scripts/base16-solarized-light.sh">shell script</a> that I run when my shell starts, but that means the
colours get lost when restoring a tmux session.</li>
</ul>
<p>and probably more things I haven&rsquo;t thought of. &ldquo;Using tmux means that I have to
change how I manage my colours&rdquo; sounds unlikely, but that really did happen to
me and I decided &ldquo;well, I don&rsquo;t want to change how I manage colours right now,
so I guess I&rsquo;m not using that feature!&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also hard to remember which features I&rsquo;m relying on &ndash; for example maybe
my current terminal <em>does</em> have OSC 52 support and because copying from tmux over SSH
has always Just Worked I don&rsquo;t even realize that that&rsquo;s something I need, and
then it mysteriously stops working when I switch terminals.</p>
<h3 id="change-things-slowly">change things slowly</h3>
<p>Personally even though I think my setup is not <em>that</em> complicated, it&rsquo;s taken
me 20 years to get to this point! Because terminal config changes are so likely
to have unexpected and hard-to-understand consequences, I&rsquo;ve found that if I
change a lot of terminal configuration all at once it makes it much harder to
understand what went wrong if there&rsquo;s a problem, which can be really
disorienting.</p>
<p>So I usually prefer to make pretty small changes, and accept that changes can
might take me a REALLY long time to get used to. For example I switched from
using <code>ls</code> to <a href="https://github.com/eza-community/eza">eza</a> a year or two ago and
while I like it (because <code>eza -l</code> prints human-readable file sizes by default)
I&rsquo;m still not quite sure about it. But also sometimes it&rsquo;s worth it to make a
big change, like I made the switch to fish (from bash) 10 years ago and I&rsquo;m
very happy I did.</p>
<h3 id="getting-a-modern-terminal-is-not-that-easy">getting a &ldquo;modern&rdquo; terminal is not that easy</h3>
<p>Trying to explain how &ldquo;easy&rdquo; it is to configure your terminal really just made
me think that it&rsquo;s kind of hard and that I still sometimes get confused.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve found that there&rsquo;s never one perfect way to configure things in the
terminal that will be compatible with every single other thing. I just need to
try stuff, figure out some kind of locally stable state that works for me, and
accept that if I start using a new tool it might disrupt the system and I might
need to rethink things.</p>

### ["Rules" that terminal programs follow](https://jvns.ca/blog/2024/11/26/terminal-rules/)

**来源**: Julia Evans

**摘要**: <p>Recently I&rsquo;ve been thinking about how everything that happens in the terminal
is some combination of:</p>
<ol>
<li>Your <strong>operating system</strong>&rsquo;s job</li>
<li>Your <strong>shell</strong>&rsquo;s job</li>
<li>Your <strong>terminal emulator</strong>&rsquo;s job</li>
<li>The job of <strong>whatever program you happen to be running</strong> (like <code>top</code> or <code>vim</code> or <code>cat</code>)</li>
</ol>
<p>The first three (your operating system, shell, and terminal emulator) are all kind of
known quantities &ndash; if you&rsquo;re using bash in GNOME Terminal on Linux, you can
more or less reason about how how all of those things interact, and some of
their behaviour is standardized by POSIX.</p>
<p>But the fourth one (&ldquo;whatever program you happen to be running&rdquo;) feels like it
could do ANYTHING. How are you supposed to know how a program is going to
behave?</p>
<p>This post is kind of long so here&rsquo;s a quick table of contents:</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="programs-behave-surprisingly-consistently">programs behave surprisingly consistently</h3>
<p>As far as I know, there are no real standards for how programs in the terminal
should behave &ndash; the closest things I know of are:</p>
<ul>
<li>POSIX, which mostly dictates how your terminal emulator / OS / shell should
work together. I think it does specify a few things about how core utilities like
<code>cp</code> should work but AFAIK it doesn&rsquo;t have anything to say about how for
example <code>htop</code> should behave.</li>
<li>these <a href="https://clig.dev/">command line interface guidelines</a></li>
</ul>
<p>But even though there are no standards, in my experience programs in the
terminal behave in a pretty consistent way. So I wanted to write down a list of
&ldquo;rules&rdquo; that in my experience programs mostly follow.</p>
<h3 id="these-are-meant-to-be-descriptive-not-prescriptive">these are meant to be descriptive, not prescriptive</h3>
<p>My goal here isn&rsquo;t to convince authors of terminal programs that they <em>should</em>
follow any of these rules. There are lots of exceptions to these and often
there&rsquo;s a good reason for those exceptions.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s very useful for me to know what behaviour to expect from a random new
terminal program that I&rsquo;m using. Instead of &ldquo;uh, programs could do literally
anything&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;ok, here are the basic rules I expect, and then I can keep a
short mental list of exceptions&rdquo;.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m just writing down what I&rsquo;ve observed about how programs behave in my 20
years of using the terminal, why I think they behave that way, and some
examples of cases where that rule is &ldquo;broken&rdquo;.</p>
<h3 id="it-s-not-always-obvious-which-rules-are-the-program-s-responsibility-to-implement">it&rsquo;s not always obvious which &ldquo;rules&rdquo; are the program&rsquo;s responsibility to implement</h3>
<p>There are a bunch of common conventions that I think are pretty clearly the
program&rsquo;s responsibility to implement, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>config files should go in <code>~/.BLAHrc</code> or <code>~/.config/BLAH/FILE</code> or <code>/etc/BLAH/</code> or something</li>
<li><code>--help</code> should print help text</li>
<li>programs should print &ldquo;regular&rdquo; output to stdout and errors to stderr</li>
</ul>
<p>But in this post I&rsquo;m going to focus on things that it&rsquo;s not 100% obvious are
the program&rsquo;s responsibility. For example it feels to me like a &ldquo;law of nature&rdquo;
that pressing <code>Ctrl-D</code> should quit a REPL, but programs often
need to explicitly implement support for it &ndash; even though <code>cat</code> doesn&rsquo;t need
to implement <code>Ctrl-D</code> support, <code>ipython</code> <a href="https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit/blob/a2a12300c635ab3c051566e363ed27d853af4b21/src/prompt_toolkit/shortcuts/prompt.py#L824-L837">does</a>. (more about that in &ldquo;rule 3&rdquo; below)</p>
<p>Understanding which things are the program&rsquo;s responsibility makes it much less
surprising when different programs&rsquo; implementations are slightly different.</p>
<h3 id="rule-1-noninteractive-programs-should-quit-when-you-press-ctrl-c">rule 1: noninteractive programs should quit when you press <code>Ctrl-C</code></h3>
<p>The main reason for this rule is that noninteractive programs will quit by
default on <code>Ctrl-C</code> if they don&rsquo;t set up a <code>SIGINT</code> signal handler, so this is
kind of a &ldquo;you should act like the default&rdquo; rule.</p>
<p>Something that trips a lot of people up is that this doesn&rsquo;t apply to
<strong>interactive</strong> programs like <code>python3</code> or <code>bc</code> or <code>less</code>. This is because in
an interactive program, <code>Ctrl-C</code> has a different job &ndash; if the program is
running an operation (like for example a search in <code>less</code> or some Python code
in <code>python3</code>), then <code>Ctrl-C</code> will interrupt that operation but not stop the
program.</p>
<p>As an example of how this works in an interactive program: here&rsquo;s the code <a href="https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit/blob/a2a12300c635ab3c051566e363ed27d853af4b21/src/prompt_toolkit/key_binding/bindings/vi.py#L2225">in prompt-toolkit</a> (the library that iPython uses for handling input)
that aborts a search when you press <code>Ctrl-C</code>.</p>
<h3 id="rule-2-tuis-should-quit-when-you-press-q">rule 2: TUIs should quit when you press <code>q</code></h3>
<p>TUI programs (like <code>less</code> or <code>htop</code>) will usually quit when you press <code>q</code>.</p>
<p>This rule doesn&rsquo;t apply to any program where pressing <code>q</code> to quit wouldn&rsquo;t make
sense, like <code>tmux</code> or text editors.</p>
<h3 id="rule-3-repls-should-quit-when-you-press-ctrl-d-on-an-empty-line">rule 3: REPLs should quit when you press <code>Ctrl-D</code> on an empty line</h3>
<p>REPLs (like <code>python3</code> or <code>ed</code>) will usually quit when you press <code>Ctrl-D</code> on an
empty line. This rule is similar to the <code>Ctrl-C</code> rule &ndash; the reason for this is
that by default if you&rsquo;re running a program (like <code>cat</code>) in &ldquo;cooked mode&rdquo;, then
the operating system will return an <code>EOF</code> when you press <code>Ctrl-D</code> on an empty
line.</p>
<p>Most of the REPLs I use (sqlite3, python3, fish, bash, etc) don&rsquo;t actually use
cooked mode, but they all implement this keyboard shortcut anyway to mimic the
default behaviour.</p>
<p>For example, here&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit/blob/a2a12300c635ab3c051566e363ed27d853af4b21/src/prompt_toolkit/shortcuts/prompt.py#L824-L837">the code in prompt-toolkit</a>
that quits when you press Ctrl-D, and here&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/bminor/bash/blob/6794b5478f660256a1023712b5fc169196ed0a22/lib/readline/readline.c#L658-L672">the same code in readline</a>.</p>
<p>I actually thought that this one was a &ldquo;Law of Terminal Physics&rdquo; until very
recently because I&rsquo;ve basically never seen it broken, but you can see that it&rsquo;s
just something that each individual input library has to implement in the links
above.</p>
<p>Someone pointed out that the Erlang REPL does not quit when you press <code>Ctrl-D</code>,
so I guess not every REPL follows this &ldquo;rule&rdquo;.</p>
<h3 id="rule-4-don-t-use-more-than-16-colours">rule 4: don&rsquo;t use more than 16 colours</h3>
<p>Terminal programs rarely use colours other than the base 16 ANSI colours. This
is because if you specify colours with a hex code, it&rsquo;s very likely to clash
with some users&rsquo; background colour. For example if I print out some text as
<code>#EEEEEE</code>, it would be almost invisible on a white background, though it would
look fine on a dark background.</p>
<p>But if you stick to the default 16 base colours, you have a much better chance
that the user has configured those colours in their terminal emulator so that
they work reasonably well with their background color. Another reason to stick
to the default base 16 colours is that it makes less assumptions about what
colours the terminal emulator supports.</p>
<p>The only programs I usually see breaking this &ldquo;rule&rdquo; are text editors, for
example Helix by default will use a purple background which is not a default
ANSI colour. It seems fine for Helix to break this rule since Helix isn&rsquo;t a
&ldquo;core&rdquo; program and I assume any Helix user who doesn&rsquo;t like that colorscheme
will just change the theme.</p>
<h3 id="rule-5-vaguely-support-readline-keybindings">rule 5: vaguely support readline keybindings</h3>
<p>Almost every program I use supports <code>readline</code> keybindings if it would make
sense to do so. For example, here are a bunch of different programs and a link
to where they define <code>Ctrl-E</code> to go to the end of the line:</p>
<ul>
<li>ipython (<a href="https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit/blob/a2a12300c635ab3c051566e363ed27d853af4b21/src/prompt_toolkit/key_binding/bindings/emacs.py#L72">Ctrl-E defined here</a>)</li>
<li>atuin (<a href="https://github.com/atuinsh/atuin/blob/a67cfc82fe0dc907a01f07a0fd625701e062a33b/crates/atuin/src/command/client/search/interactive.rs#L407">Ctrl-E defined here</a>)</li>
<li>fzf (<a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/blob/bb55045596d6d08445f3c6d320c3ec2b457462d1/src/terminal.go#L611">Ctrl-E defined here</a>)</li>
<li>zsh (<a href="https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh/blob/86d5f24a3d28541f242eb3807379301ea976de87/Src/Zle/zle_bindings.c#L94">Ctrl-E defined here</a>)</li>
<li>fish (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/blob/99fa8aaaa7956178973150a03ce4954ab17a197b/share/functions/fish_default_key_bindings.fish#L43">Ctrl-E defined here</a>)</li>
<li>tmux&rsquo;s command prompt (<a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux/blob/ae8f2208c98e3c2d6e3fe4cad2281dce8fd11f31/key-bindings.c#L490">Ctrl-E defined here</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>None of those programs actually uses <code>readline</code> directly, they just sort of
mimic emacs/readline keybindings. They don&rsquo;t always mimic them <em>exactly</em>: for
example atuin seems to use <code>Ctrl-A</code> as a prefix, so <code>Ctrl-A</code> doesn&rsquo;t go to the
beginning of the line.</p>
<p>Also all of these programs seem to implement their own internal cut and paste
buffers so you can delete a line with <code>Ctrl-U</code> and then paste it with <code>Ctrl-Y</code>.</p>
<p>The exceptions to this are:</p>
<ul>
<li>some programs (like <code>git</code>, <code>cat</code>, and <code>nc</code>) don&rsquo;t have any line editing support at all (except for backspace, <code>Ctrl-W</code>, and <code>Ctrl-U</code>)</li>
<li>as usual text editors are an exception, every text editor has its own
approach to editing text</li>
</ul>
<p>I wrote more about this &ldquo;what keybindings does a program support?&rdquo; question in
<a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2024/07/08/readline/">entering text in the terminal is complicated</a>.</p>
<h3 id="rule-5-1-ctrl-w-should-delete-the-last-word">rule 5.1: Ctrl-W should delete the last word</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never seen a program (other than a text editor) where <code>Ctrl-W</code> <em>doesn&rsquo;t</em>
delete the last word. This is similar to the <code>Ctrl-C</code> rule &ndash; by default if a
program is in &ldquo;cooked mode&rdquo;, the OS will delete the last word if you press
<code>Ctrl-W</code>, and delete the whole line if you press <code>Ctrl-U</code>. So usually programs
will imitate that behaviour.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t think of any exceptions to this other than text editors but if there
are I&rsquo;d love to hear about them!</p>
<h3 id="rule-6-disable-colours-when-writing-to-a-pipe">rule 6: disable colours when writing to a pipe</h3>
<p>Most programs will disable colours when writing to a pipe. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>rg blah</code> will highlight all occurrences of <code>blah</code> in the output, but if the
output is to a pipe or a file, it&rsquo;ll turn off the highlighting.</li>
<li><code>ls --color=auto</code> will use colour when writing to a terminal, but not when
writing to a pipe</li>
</ul>
<p>Both of those programs will also format their output differently when writing
to the terminal: <code>ls</code> will organize files into columns, and ripgrep will group
matches with headings.</p>
<p>If you want to force the program to use colour (for example because you want to
look at the colour), you can use <code>unbuffer</code> to force the program&rsquo;s output to be
a tty like this:</p>
<pre><code>unbuffer rg blah |  less -R
</code></pre>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that there are some programs that &ldquo;break&rdquo; this rule but I can&rsquo;t think
of any examples right now. Some programs have an <code>--color</code> flag that you can
use to force colour to be on, in the example above you could also do <code>rg --color=always | less -R</code>.</p>
<h3 id="rule-7-means-stdin-stdout">rule 7: <code>-</code> means stdin/stdout</h3>
<p>Usually if you pass <code>-</code> to a program instead of a filename, it&rsquo;ll read from
stdin or write to stdout (whichever is appropriate). For example, if you want
to format the Python code that&rsquo;s on your clipboard with <code>black</code> and then copy
it, you could run:</p>
<pre><code>pbpaste | black - | pbcopy
</code></pre>
<p>(<code>pbpaste</code> is a Mac program, you can do something similar on Linux with <code>xclip</code>)</p>
<p>My impression is that most programs implement this if it would make sense and I
can&rsquo;t think of any exceptions right now, but I&rsquo;m sure there are many
exceptions.</p>
<h3 id="these-rules-take-a-long-time-to-learn">these &ldquo;rules&rdquo; take a long time to learn</h3>
<p>These rules took me a long time for me to learn because I had to:</p>
<ol>
<li>learn that the rule applied anywhere at all (&quot;<code>Ctrl-C</code> will exit programs&quot;)</li>
<li>notice some exceptions (&ldquo;okay, <code>Ctrl-C</code> will exit <code>find</code> but not <code>less</code>&rdquo;)</li>
<li>subconsciously figure out what the pattern is (&quot;<code>Ctrl-C</code> will generally quit
noninteractive programs, but in interactive programs it might interrupt the
current operation instead of quitting the program&quot;)</li>
<li>eventually maybe formulate it into an explicit rule that I know</li>
</ol>
<p>A lot of my understanding of the terminal is honestly still in the
&ldquo;subconscious pattern recognition&rdquo; stage. The only reason I&rsquo;ve been taking the
time to make things explicit at all is because I&rsquo;ve been trying to explain how
it works to others. Hopefully writing down these &ldquo;rules&rdquo; explicitly will make
learning some of this stuff a little bit faster for others.</p>

### [Why pipes sometimes get "stuck": buffering](https://jvns.ca/blog/2024/11/29/why-pipes-get-stuck-buffering/)

**来源**: Julia Evans

**摘要**: <p>Here&rsquo;s a niche terminal problem that has bothered me for years but that I never
really understood until a few weeks ago. Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re running this command
to watch for some specific output in a log file:</p>
<pre><code>tail -f /some/log/file | grep thing1 | grep thing2
</code></pre>
<p>If log lines are being added to the file relatively slowly, the result I&rsquo;d see
is&hellip; nothing! It doesn&rsquo;t matter if there were matches in the log file or not,
there just wouldn&rsquo;t be any output.</p>
<p>I internalized this as &ldquo;uh, I guess pipes just get stuck sometimes and don&rsquo;t
show me the output, that&rsquo;s weird&rdquo;, and I&rsquo;d handle it by just
running <code>grep thing1 /some/log/file | grep thing2</code> instead, which would work.</p>
<p>So as I&rsquo;ve been doing a terminal deep dive over the last few months I was
really excited to finally learn exactly why this happens.</p>
<h3 id="why-this-happens-buffering">why this happens: buffering</h3>
<p>The reason why &ldquo;pipes get stuck&rdquo; sometimes is that it&rsquo;s VERY common for
programs to buffer their output before writing it to a pipe or file. So the
pipe is working fine, the problem is that the program never even wrote the data
to the pipe!</p>
<p>This is for performance reasons: writing all output immediately as soon as you
can uses more system calls, so it&rsquo;s more efficient to save up data until you
have 8KB or so of data to write (or until the program exits) and THEN write it
to the pipe.</p>
<p>In this example:</p>
<pre><code>tail -f /some/log/file | grep thing1 | grep thing2
</code></pre>
<p>the problem is that <code>grep thing1</code> is saving up all of its matches until it has
8KB of data to write, which might literally never happen.</p>
<h3 id="programs-don-t-buffer-when-writing-to-a-terminal">programs don&rsquo;t buffer when writing to a terminal</h3>
<p>Part of why I found this so disorienting is that <code>tail -f file | grep thing</code>
will work totally fine, but then when you add the second <code>grep</code>, it stops
working!! The reason for this is that the way <code>grep</code> handles buffering depends
on whether it&rsquo;s writing to a terminal or not.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how <code>grep</code> (and many other programs) decides to buffer its output:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check if stdout is a terminal or not using the <code>isatty</code> function
<ul>
<li>If it&rsquo;s a terminal, use line buffering (print every line immediately as soon as you have it)</li>
<li>Otherwise, use &ldquo;block buffering&rdquo; &ndash; only print data if you have at least 8KB or so of data to print</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So if <code>grep</code> is writing directly to your terminal then you&rsquo;ll see the line as
soon as it&rsquo;s printed, but if it&rsquo;s writing to a pipe, you won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Of course the buffer size isn&rsquo;t always 8KB for every program, it depends on the implementation. For <code>grep</code> the buffering is handled by libc, and libc&rsquo;s buffer size is
defined in the <code>BUFSIZ</code> variable. <a href="https://github.com/bminor/glibc/blob/c69e8cccaff8f2d89cee43202623b33e6ef5d24a/libio/stdio.h#L100">Here&rsquo;s where that&rsquo;s defined in glibc</a>.</p>
<p>(as an aside: &ldquo;programs do not use 8KB output buffers when writing to a
terminal&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t, like, a law of terminal physics, a program COULD use an 8KB
buffer when writing output to a terminal if it wanted, it would just be
extremely weird if it did that, I can&rsquo;t think of any program that behaves that
way)</p>
<h3 id="commands-that-buffer-commands-that-don-t">commands that buffer &amp; commands that don&rsquo;t</h3>
<p>One annoying thing about this buffering behaviour is that you kind of need to
remember which commands buffer their output when writing to a pipe.</p>
<p>Some commands that <strong>don&rsquo;t</strong> buffer their output:</p>
<ul>
<li>tail</li>
<li>cat</li>
<li>tee</li>
</ul>
<p>I think almost everything else will buffer output, especially if it&rsquo;s a command
where you&rsquo;re likely to be using it for batch processing. Here&rsquo;s a list of some
common commands that buffer their output when writing to a pipe, along with the
flag that disables block buffering.</p>
<ul>
<li>grep (<code>--line-buffered</code>)</li>
<li>sed (<code>-u</code>)</li>
<li>awk (there&rsquo;s a <code>fflush()</code> function)</li>
<li>tcpdump (<code>-l</code>)</li>
<li>jq (<code>-u</code>)</li>
<li>tr (<code>-u</code>)</li>
<li>cut (can&rsquo;t disable buffering)</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are all the ones I can think of, lots of unix commands (like <code>sort</code>) may
or may not buffer their output but it doesn&rsquo;t matter because <code>sort</code> can&rsquo;t do
anything until it finishes receiving input anyway.</p>
<p>Also I did my best to test both the Mac OS and GNU versions of these but there
are a lot of variations and I might have made some mistakes.</p>
<h3 id="programming-languages-where-the-default-print-statement-buffers">programming languages where the default &ldquo;print&rdquo; statement buffers</h3>
<p>Also, here are a few programming language where the default print statement
will buffer output when writing to a pipe, and some ways to disable buffering
if you want:</p>
<ul>
<li>C (disable with <code>setvbuf</code>)</li>
<li>Python (disable with <code>python -u</code>, or <code>PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1</code>, or <code>sys.stdout.reconfigure(line_buffering=False)</code>, or <code>print(x, flush=True)</code>)</li>
<li>Ruby (disable with <code>STDOUT.sync = true</code>)</li>
<li>Perl (disable with <code>$| = 1</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>I assume that these languages are designed this way so that the default print
function will be fast when you&rsquo;re doing batch processing.</p>
<p>Also whether output is buffered or not might depend on how you print, for
example in C++ <code>cout &lt;&lt; &quot;hello\n&quot;</code> buffers when writing to a pipe but <code>cout &lt;&lt; &quot;hello&quot; &lt;&lt; endl</code> will flush its output.</p>
<h3 id="when-you-press-ctrl-c-on-a-pipe-the-contents-of-the-buffer-are-lost">when you press <code>Ctrl-C</code> on a pipe, the contents of the buffer are lost</h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re running this command as a hacky way to watch for DNS requests
to <code>example.com</code>, and you forgot to pass <code>-l</code> to tcpdump:</p>
<pre><code>sudo tcpdump -ni any port 53 | grep example.com
</code></pre>
<p>When you press <code>Ctrl-C</code>, what happens? In a magical perfect world, what I would
<em>want</em> to happen is for <code>tcpdump</code> to flush its buffer, <code>grep</code> would search for
<code>example.com</code>, and I would see all the output I missed.</p>
<p>But in the real world, what happens is that all the programs get killed and the
output in <code>tcpdump</code>&rsquo;s buffer is lost.</p>
<p>I think this problem is probably unavoidable &ndash; I spent a little time with
<code>strace</code> to see how this works and <code>grep</code> receives the <code>SIGINT</code> before
<code>tcpdump</code> anyway so even if <code>tcpdump</code> tried to flush its buffer <code>grep</code> would
already be dead.</p>
<small>
<p>After a little more investigation, there is a workaround: if you find
<code>tcpdump</code>&rsquo;s PID and <code>kill -TERM $PID</code>, then tcpdump will flush the buffer so
you can see the output. That&rsquo;s kind of a pain but I tested it and it seems to
work.</p>
</small>
<h3 id="redirecting-to-a-file-also-buffers">redirecting to a file also buffers</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just pipes, this will also buffer:</p>
<pre><code>sudo tcpdump -ni any port 53 &gt; output.txt
</code></pre>
<p>Redirecting to a file doesn&rsquo;t have the same &ldquo;<code>Ctrl-C</code> will totally destroy the
contents of the buffer&rdquo; problem though &ndash; in my experience it usually behaves
more like you&rsquo;d want, where the contents of the buffer get written to the file
before the program exits. I&rsquo;m not 100% sure whether this is something you can
always rely on or not.</p>
<h3 id="a-bunch-of-potential-ways-to-avoid-buffering">a bunch of potential ways to avoid buffering</h3>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s talk solutions. Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;ve run this command:</p>
<pre><code>tail -f /some/log/file | grep thing1 | grep thing2
</code></pre>
<p>I asked people on Mastodon how they would solve this in practice and there were
5 basic approaches. Here they are:</p>
<h4 id="solution-1-run-a-program-that-finishes-quickly">solution 1: run a program that finishes quickly</h4>
<p>Historically my solution to this has been to just avoid the &ldquo;command writing to
pipe slowly&rdquo; situation completely and instead run a program that will finish quickly
like this:</p>
<pre><code>cat /some/log/file | grep thing1 | grep thing2 | tail
</code></pre>
<p>This doesn&rsquo;t do the same thing as the original command but it does mean that
you get to avoid thinking about these weird buffering issues.</p>
<p>(you could also do <code>grep thing1 /some/log/file</code> but I often prefer to use an
&ldquo;unnecessary&rdquo; <code>cat</code>)</p>
<h4 id="solution-2-remember-the-line-buffer-flag-to-grep">solution 2: remember the &ldquo;line buffer&rdquo; flag to grep</h4>
<p>You could remember that grep has a flag to avoid buffering and pass it like this:</p>
<pre><code>tail -f /some/log/file | grep --line-buffered thing1 | grep thing2
</code></pre>
<h4 id="solution-3-use-awk">solution 3: use awk</h4>
<p>Some people said that if they&rsquo;re specifically dealing with a multiple greps
situation, they&rsquo;ll rewrite it to use a single <code>awk</code> instead, like this:</p>
<pre><code>tail -f /some/log/file |  awk '/thing1/ &amp;&amp; /thing2/'
</code></pre>
<p>Or you would write a more complicated <code>grep</code>, like this:</p>
<pre><code>tail -f /some/log/file |  grep -E 'thing1.*thing2'
</code></pre>
<p>(<code>awk</code> also buffers, so for this to work you&rsquo;ll want <code>awk</code> to be the last command in the pipeline)</p>
<h4 id="solution-4-use-stdbuf">solution 4: use <code>stdbuf</code></h4>
<p><code>stdbuf</code> uses LD_PRELOAD to turn off libc&rsquo;s buffering, and you can use it to turn off output buffering like this:</p>
<pre><code>tail -f /some/log/file | stdbuf -o0 grep thing1 | grep thing2
</code></pre>
<p>Like any <code>LD_PRELOAD</code> solution it&rsquo;s a bit unreliable &ndash; it doesn&rsquo;t work on
static binaries, I think won&rsquo;t work if the program isn&rsquo;t using libc&rsquo;s
buffering, and doesn&rsquo;t always work on Mac OS. Harry Marr has a really nice <a href="https://hmarr.com/blog/how-stdbuf-works/">How stdbuf works</a> post.</p>
<h4 id="solution-5-use-unbuffer">solution 5: use <code>unbuffer</code></h4>
<p><code>unbuffer program</code> will force the program&rsquo;s output to be a TTY, which means
that it&rsquo;ll behave the way it normally would on a TTY (less buffering, colour
output, etc). You could use it in this example like this:</p>
<pre><code>tail -f /some/log/file | unbuffer grep thing1 | grep thing2
</code></pre>
<p>Unlike <code>stdbuf</code> it will always work, though it might have unwanted side
effects, for example <code>grep thing1</code>&rsquo;s will also colour matches.</p>
<p>If you want to install unbuffer, it&rsquo;s in the <code>expect</code> package.</p>
<h3 id="that-s-all-the-solutions-i-know-about">that&rsquo;s all the solutions I know about!</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bit hard for me to say which one is &ldquo;best&rdquo;, I think personally I&rsquo;m
mostly likely to use <code>unbuffer</code> because I know it&rsquo;s always going to work.</p>
<p>If I learn about more solutions I&rsquo;ll try to add them to this post.</p>
<h3 id="i-m-not-really-sure-how-often-this-comes-up">I&rsquo;m not really sure how often this comes up</h3>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s not very common for me to have a program that slowly trickles data
into a pipe like this, normally if I&rsquo;m using a pipe a bunch of data gets
written very quickly, processed by everything in the pipeline, and then
everything exits. The only examples I can come up with right now are:</p>
<ul>
<li>tcpdump</li>
<li><code>tail -f</code></li>
<li>watching log files in a different way like with <code>kubectl logs</code></li>
<li>the output of a slow computation</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-if-there-were-an-environment-variable-to-disable-buffering">what if there were an environment variable to disable buffering?</h3>
<p>I think it would be cool if there were a standard environment variable to turn
off buffering, like <code>PYTHONUNBUFFERED</code> in Python. I got this idea from a
<a href="https://blog.plover.com/Unix/stdio-buffering.html">couple</a> of <a href="https://blog.plover.com/Unix/stdio-buffering-2.html">blog posts</a> by Mark Dominus
in 2018. Maybe <code>NO_BUFFER</code> like <a href="https://no-color.org/">NO_COLOR</a>?</p>
<p>The design seems tricky to get right; Mark points out that NETBSD has <a href="https://man.netbsd.org/setbuf.3">environment variables called <code>STDBUF</code>, <code>STDBUF1</code>, etc</a> which gives you a
ton of control over buffering but I imagine most developers don&rsquo;t want to
implement many different environment variables to handle a relatively minor
edge case.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also curious about whether there are any programs that just automatically
flush their output buffers after some period of time (like 1 second). It feels
like it would be nice in theory but I can&rsquo;t think of any program that does that
so I imagine there are some downsides.</p>
<h3 id="stuff-i-left-out">stuff I left out</h3>
<p>Some things I didn&rsquo;t talk about in this post since these posts have been
getting pretty long recently and seriously does anyone REALLY want to read 3000
words about buffering?</p>
<ul>
<li>the difference between line buffering and having totally unbuffered output</li>
<li>how buffering to stderr is different from buffering to stdout</li>
<li>this post is only about buffering that happens <strong>inside the program</strong>, your
operating system&rsquo;s TTY driver also does a little bit of buffering sometimes</li>
<li>other reasons you might need to flush your output other than &ldquo;you&rsquo;re writing
to a pipe&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

### [2025 Recap: so many projects](https://fasterthanli.me/articles/2025-recap)

**摘要**: <p>I’ve been working on so many projects in 2025, I thought it was important for me

### [Introducing arborium, a tree-sitter distribution](https://fasterthanli.me/articles/introducing-arborium)

**来源**: Amos (fasterthanlime)

**摘要**: <p>About two weeks ago I entered a discussion with the docs.rs team about,
basically, why we have to look at this:</p>

<p><source media="(max-width: 400px)" type="image/jxl" /><source media="(max-width: 900px)" type="image/jxl" /><source type="image/jxl" /><source media="(max-width: 400px)" type="image/avif" /><source media="(max-width: 900px)" type="image/avif" /><source type="image/avif" /><source media="(max-width: 400px)" type="image/webp" /><source media="(max-width: 900px)" type="image/webp" /><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="My browser showing a docs.rs page for a crate that I published myself, which contains a lot of different code blocks with different languages but they're all white on black.

In an effort to understand those reasons, I opened a GitHub issue which resulted
in a <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/docs.rs/issues/3040">short but productive</a> discussion.</p>

<p>I walked away discouraged, and then decided to, reasons be damned, attack this
problem from three different angles.</p>

### [All color is best-effort](https://fasterthanli.me/articles/all-color-is-best-effort)

**来源**: Amos (fasterthanlime)

**摘要**: <p>I do not come to you with answers today, but rather some observations and a lot of questions.</p>

<a class="anchor" href="https://fasterthanli.me/index.xml#the-weird-glitch" id="the-weird-glitch"><h2>The weird glitch</h2></a>
<p>Recently I was editing some video and I noticed this:</p>

<p>



<source media="(max-width: 400px)" type="image/jxl" /><source media="(max-width: 900px)" type="image/jxl" /><source type="image/jxl" /><source media="(max-width: 400px)" type="image/avif" /><source media="(max-width: 900px)" type="image/avif" /><source type="image/avif" /><source media="(max-width: 400px)" type="image/webp" /><source media="(max-width: 900px)" type="image/webp" /><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="A screenshot of the video, there are visible circles at various places in the image. Some of them are black, some of them are white. The image itself shows some blue and white text composited on some blurry background, which doesn’t really matter for this, and there’s a red line horizontal up in the image. It’s very confusing." height="1126" src="https://cdn.fasterthanli.me/content/articles/all-color-is-best-effort/dvr-circles@2x~3c031f1f42693336.jxl" title="A screenshot of the video, there are visible circles at various places in the image. Some of them are black, some of them are white. The image itself shows some blue and white text composited on some blurry background, which doesn’t really matter for this, and there’s a red line horizontal up in the image. It’s very confusing." width="1966" /></p>

<p>Not what the finger is pointing at — the dots.</p>

<p>Here are the separate layers this image is made up of: the background is a stock image
I’ve licensed from Envato Elements:</p>

<p><source media="(max-width: 400px)" type="image/jxl" /><source media="(max-width: 900px)" type="image/jxl" /><source type="image/jxl" /><source media="(max-width: 400px)" type="image/avif" /><source media="(max-width: 900px)" type="image/avif" /><source type="image/avif" /><source media="(max-width: 400px)" type="image/webp" /><source media="(max-width: 900px)" type="image/webp" /><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="A picture of a canyon, darker than you’d expect." height="1126" src="https://cdn.fasterthanli.me/content/articles/all-color-is-best-effort/canyon-background@2x~dcfb5771209ddbd5.jxl" title="A picture of a canyon, darker than you’d expect." width="1966" /></p>

<p>Because I use it as a background image, I’ve cranked down the exposition in the Color tab:</p>
