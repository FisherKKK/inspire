## 2. Document是一门艺术

不论是初创公司还是一个项目的起步阶段, 建立知识文档既是一种技术积累, 也可以帮助成员能更好的进行学习和解决问题, 因此很多问题往往是重复的, 而建立一个问题索引往往可以节省很多人力物力.

## 3. Deliberate Practice Make Better

原文在这里, 非常长的一篇文章: [The Ultimate Deliberate Practice Guide: How to Be the Best (fs.blog)](https://fs.blog/deliberate-practice-guide/)

文章的一些摘要:

* While engaging in deliberate practice, we are always looking for errors or areas of weakness. Once we identify one, we establish a plan for improving it. If one approach doesn’t work, we keep trying new ones until something does.
* If we want to improve a skill, we need to know \*what\* exactly has to change and what might get us there. Otherwise, we plateau.
* Life is not always a matter of holding good cards, but sometimes, playing a poor hand well
* No matter what the field, the most effective approach to improving performance is to follow a single set of principles.
* Everyone has talent. What’s rare is the courage to follow it to the dark places where it leads
* We can’t expect constant improvement if we keep repeating the elements of a skill we already know how to do with ease
* Having lots of little, realistic goals with a game plan for achieving them makes deliberate practice motivating
* 如何实现: Take the skill you’re aiming to improve and break it down into the smallest possible component parts. Make a plan for working through them in a logical order, beginning with the fundamentals, then building upon them. Decide which parts you’d like to master over the next month. Put your practice sessions in your calendar, then plan precisely which parts of the skill you’re going to work on during each session(将一项技能分成小部分, 然后按照逻辑顺序排序, 一步一步从基础开始设定目标和计划, 不断练习提高. 这个计划会随着训练过程不断的变化, 由于在练习过程中会发现新的weakness, 关键的问题是要保持正轨避免浪费时间, 不断弄清楚是为什么让你和下一层次的表现脱节, 并为之不断练习)
* One must develop an instinct for what one can just barely achieve through one’s greatest efforts.
* Seeing as deliberate practice requires us to keep targeting our weakest areas, it means spending time doing stuff we’re not good at. In the moment, that can feel pretty miserable. But the quickest route to improvement involves stepping outside of our comfort zones.
* there was an inverse correlation between the usefulness of an activity and its enjoyability.(活动的有用性和有趣性存在一个明显的负相关性)
* The reason that most people don’t possess these extraordinary physical capabilities isn’t because they don’t have the capacity for them, but rather because they’re satisfied to live in the comfortable rut of homeostasis and never do the work that is required to get out of it. They live in the world of “good enough.” The same thing is true for all the mental activities we engage in.
* This is a fundamental truth about any sort of practice: If you never push yourself beyond your comfort zone, you will never improve
* **A quick way to assess if you’re doing deliberate practice or just regular rote practice is to ask yourself if you ever feel bored or zone out during practice sessions. If the answer is yes, you’re probably not practicing deliberately.**(刻意训练的检验方式)
* Repetition inside the comfort zone does not equal deliberate practice. Deliberate practice requires that you operate in the learning zone and you repeat the activity a lot with feedback.(刻意训练并非发生在舒适区中, 而是在能力的边缘试探, 虽然问题很难, 但是想办法却总能解决)
* 如何实现: Each time you practice a component of a skill, aim to make it 10% harder than the level you find comfortable.(每次的刻意练习都要比舒适区难10%)
* A common deliberate practice mistake is to plan a long practice session, then adjust the intensity of your practice to allow you to engage in a skill for the whole time. It’s far more effective to engage in “sprints.” Practice with the most intense focus you can manage for short periods of time, then take breaks. Seeing as you learn most when you stretch yourself beyond your current capabilities, shorter, more challenging practice periods are the way to go.(长周期和长时间的训练往往没有短期冲刺来得重要, 在短时间内集中精力练习, 然后休息一下, 当超越当前能力时, 学到的东西最多, 时间更短)
* Deliberate practice needs to be sustainable for the long term. How long a person keeps at a skill is often far more important than how many hours a day they spend on it.
* 如何实现: Make a list of activities you can engage in without too much conscious thought, letting yourself daydream while you do them. Common examples include going for a walk, washing the dishes, taking a shower, free-writing in a journal, playing with a toy like Lego, driving a familiar route, gardening, cooking, listening to music, or just gazing out the window. When you feel yourself getting tired or hitting a roadblock during deliberate practice, don’t keep pushing for too long. You want to be stretching yourself, not exhausting yourself. Instead, switch to one of those more relaxing activities for at least five minutes. You’ll likely come back to practice with new connections or at last feeling refreshed.(选取一些策略进行放松, 练习的时候完全投入, 放松的时候完全放空)
* When measuring your performance, beware of vanity metrics. These are numbers that are easy to calculate and feel good to boost. But they don’t actually move the needle towards the real improvements in performance that help you reach your goals. For example, let’s say you’re using deliberate practice to improve the skill of email marketing, as part of the wider goal of getting more customers for your business. The number of email subscribers is a vanity metric; the number of paying customers is a useful metric. It’s completely possible to increase the former without a corresponding increase in the latter.
* 如何实现: Identify the most significant metrics related to performance in your chosen skill and keep a record of them each time you practice. It’s easy to fool yourself without a clear record of how you’re doing. You might want to break the skill down into a few different parts to measure it, but make sure you’re not fixating on vanity metrics. (在每次训练中记录自己的表现指标, 但是要注意虚荣指标虽然很容易衡量并感到满足, 但是实际上的作用并不会很多)
* The best teacher is not the one who knows most but the one who is most capable of reducing knowledge to that simple compound of the obvious and wonderful
* 如何实现: Don’t expect the same teacher to suit you forever. We usually need different teachers as our skill level progresses because we outgrow them. One attribute of a good teacher is that they know when to tell a student to move on. As we reach expert levels of performance, we need teachers who are themselves experts. If they’re always a step ahead, we can learn from their mistakes instead of making our own. (永远听从老师的建议, 寻找比自己更专业的老师, 从中吸取教训和经验)
* You get the best results from working with a coach if you show yourself to be receptive to constructive criticism, even if it’s uncomfortable to hear. If you respond badly, you disincentivize them from telling you what’s most useful to know. Top performers know the goal is to get better, not just to hear you’re already great. (人的目标是变得更好, 可有可无的夸赞往往没有那么重要)
* 如何实现: Make a list of the reasons you want to work on a skill and the benefits getting better at it might bring. Before you begin a deep practice session, reread the list to remind you of why you’re bringing your full focus to something difficult. You could also list some of the benefits you’ve experienced from it in the past or include quotes from top performers in your field you find inspiring. It might feel cheesy, but it can provide a powerful boost during particularly difficult practice moments. Try to focus on intrinsic reasons and benefits, such as feeling fulfilled. (内在驱动往往更重要)
* a largely self-directed apprenticeship that lasts some five to ten years [and] receives little attention because it does not contain stories of great achievement or discovery.
* If we want to master a skill, we need to commit to working on it for a lengthy period of time, likely with few rewards. While there are no assurances that with struggle comes reward, without it the odds are lower.
* You seldom improve much without giving the task your full attention
*  [Put the big rocks in first](https://fs.blog/2013/02/things-you-should-focus-on/). You can do anything, but you can’t do everything. Figure out which practice activities have the biggest influence on your performance and plan to engage in those first before you even consider activities that offer marginal gains. (专注于事情, 做对你最重要的事情)
* Memory mastery comes from repeated exposure to the same material. The spacing effect refers to how we are better able to recall information and concepts if we learn them in multiple sessions with increasingly large intervals between them. The most effective way to learn new information is through spaced repetition. It works for learning almost anything, and research has provided robust evidence of its efficacy for people of all ages—and even for animals. (记忆掌握的最好方式就是重复, 不同间隔的重复使记忆力得到巩固和加强)
* There is also minimal variation in the way the material is presented to the brain when it is repeatedly visited over a short time. This tends to decrease our learning. In contrast, when repetition learning takes place over a longer period, it is more likely that the materials are presented differently. We have to retrieve the previously learned information from memory and hence reinforce it. All of this leads us to become more interested in the content and therefore more receptive to learning it. (也就是说短时间的重复会让人感到无聊, 但是一段间隔之后的长度会产生检索和能力边缘效应)
* 如何实现: Forget about cramming. Each time you’re learning a new component of a skill, make a schedule for when you’ll review it. Typical systems involve going over information after an hour, then a day, then every other day, then weekly, then fortnightly, then monthly, then every six months, then yearly. Guess correctly and the information moves to the next level and is reviewed less often. Guess incorrectly and it moves down a level and is reviewed more often. (这就类似Ankle闪卡了)
* Another downside of deliberate practice is that the level of focus it requires can mean **practitioners miss out on other parts of life**. Top performers often devote almost every waking hour to practice, recuperation from practice, and support activities. For example, a professional dancer might spend several hours a day on deliberate practice with all of the remaining hours going toward sleep, low-impact exercise, stretching, preparing nutritious food, icing his feet, and so on. There is enormous satisfaction in the flow states produced by deliberate practice, but practitioners can absolutely miss out on other sources of happiness, such as spending time with friends. (也就是意味着要想得到什么就意味着要舍弃什么)

## 4. 适合程序员的DP

一种方式:

* 使用工具的能力, 例如使用Vim研究命令行操作
* 解决问题的能力, 不断去尝试项目
* 研究问题的能力, 研究别人的代码; 不去Copy别人的代码, 相反是自己手打代码充分理解代码的含义

浏览了大部分的帖子, 似乎大多程序员认为没有适合编程的DP, 或者说很多人都在尝试找到这个DP. 因为不论是Jam或者Kata都只是重复, 而DP更加强调在自己极限的状态下去尝试, 不断瞄准自己的短板, 然后获得即使的反馈, 非常类似强化学习的过程.

但是我觉得可以尽量向这个方面去靠:

* 研究别人的代码
* 尝试不同的开源项目
* 理解新的概念
* 跳出舒适圈, 去尝试有挑战的东西
